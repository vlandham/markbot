                                                Abstract. In this paper we construct a tilting sheaf for Severi-
                                                Brauer Varieties and Involution Varieties. This sheaf relates the
                                                derived category of each variety to the derived category of mod-
                                                ules over a ring whose semisimple component consists of the Tits
                                                algebras of the corresponding linear algebraic group.

                                            The origin of this direction of research is the classic paper [5] of
                                         Beilinson, where it is shown that the derived category of the projec-
                                         tive space PC (V ) that the sheaves O, O(−1), . . . O(− dim(V ) + 1) form
                                         a simple set of generators, (what is called a strong exceptional collec-
                                         tion). In [16], Kapranov generalized these calculations to form strong

exceptional collections for Grassmannians and Quadrics over C. All of
these varieties are Projective Homogeneous Varieties. That is, they are
of the form G/P , where G is a semisimple linear algebraic group and P
is a parabolic subgroup. It is a conjecture of Catanese that every G/P
should possess such a collection, and there have been several results in
this direction (see [9],[18], [19], and [12], among others).
   In this paper, we will work in another direction. The varieties con-
sidered here are twisted projective homogeneous varieties. These are
varieties X deﬁned over a ﬁeld which, after extension of scalars to a sep-
arable closure, become isomorphic to some G/P . Examples of such va-
rieties are Severi-Brauer Varieties and Involution Varieties. The group
G is of type A for Severi-Brauer varieties and of type D for Involution
Varieties.
   Examples of such varieties are Severi-Brauer Varieties and Involution
Varieties. Instead of producing exceptional collections, in this paper
we follow [3] and produce tilting sheaves (see Section 2 for a deﬁnition).
Our main result is to produce a locally free sheaf T on X which induces
a derived equivalence
                D b (Coh(X)) → D b (   mod − End(T )).
   This paper is heavily inﬂuenced by [22], where the Quillen K-theory
of twisted Projective Homogeneous Varieties is computed. In [8], the
author produced a locally sheaf F on a del Pezzo surface S of degree
6 which was used to describe the K-theory of S. Later, in [7], it was
shown that the same sheaf F is a tilting sheaf for the surface S. This
paper completes the chain by showing that the sheaves produced in [22]
can be used to develop derived equivalences for some twisted Projective
Homogeneous Varieties. The arguments in this paper follow a similar
line of reasoning to that found in [7].
   In Section 2, we recall the deﬁnition of a tilting sheaf, our main
tool for constructing the desired derived equivalences. In Section 3, we
recall some needed facts about modules and generation of categories
and in 4, we brieﬂy recall some basic properties of semisimple linear
algebraic groups. In particular we state the Borel-Weil-Bott Theorem
(Theorem 4.1), which we will use repeatedly. In the remainder of the
paper, we construct tilting sheaves for Severi-Brauer Varieties, Gener-
alized Severi-Brauer Varieties, and Involution Varieties. We conclude
in Section 8 with an application on computing the Quillen K-theory of
these varieties.

1.1. Notation. Let us ﬁx some notation. We will let F denote a ﬁeld,
and F a ﬁxed separable closure of F . The group Γ := Gal(F /F ) is the

                                                                      3

Galois group. By a variety X over F we mean a reduced scheme of ﬁnite
type over Spec(F ). The abelian category of quasicoherent sheaves on
X will be denoted Qcoh(X), and Coh(X) is the abelian subcategory
of sheaves on X. For a ring R, mod − R (resp. R − mod ) is the
abelian category of ﬁnitely generated right (resp. left) R-modules.
   If A is an abelian category, then D(A) will denote the correspond-
ing derived category A (confer [13, Chapter III]). This is a triangulated
category objects are complexes with terms in A, and maps homomor-
phisms of chain complexes, modulo homotopy equivalences, and lo-
calizing the set of quasi-isomorphisms. The subcategory of bounded
complexes will be denoted D b (A). If M ∈ A, by abuse of notation
we will use the same symbol to denote the complex in D b (A) with M
concentrated in degree 0 and every other term equal zero.

1.2. Acknowledgments. The author would like to thank Patrick Bros-
nan, Alexander Merkurjev, Edward Richmond for many useful discus-
sions.

                             2. Tilting Sheaf
   We say that a sheaf T on a smooth variety X is a tilting sheaf if the
following conditions hold:
      • The sheaf T has no self extensions, i.e. RHomDb (X) (T [i], T ) =
        0, for i > 0.
      • The algebra EndOX (T ) of global endomorphisms of the sheaf
        T has ﬁnite global dimension (see Section 3 for a deﬁnition of
        global dimension of a ring).
      • There is no proper thick subcategory of D b (Coh(X)) containing
        the element T (see Section 3.1 for a deﬁnition of thick).
   Our main tool in this paper is the following theorem.
Theorem 2.1 (Theorem 3.12 of [3]). Let X be a smooth variety, and
let M ∈ Coh(X) be a tilting sheaf with S := EndOX (M). Then the
functors
              F := Hom(M, −) : Coh(X) →         mod − S
                   G := − ⊗ M :      mod − S → Coh(X)
induce equivalences of categories,
                RF : D b (Coh(X)) → D b (    mod − S)
                LG : D b (    mod − S) → D b (Coh(X)),
inverse to each other.

                       3. Global Dimension
   Let R be a ring. The projective dimension of an arbitrary left R-
module T is denoted by pdimR T . The global (homological) dimension
of R is supremum of pdimR T over all such modules T .
Proposition 3.1 ([2], Prop III.2.7). Let R and S be artinian F -
algebras , and M an R-S-bimodule, ﬁnitely generated over F . If S
is a semisimple ring, then

                   R M
           gldim            = max{pdimR M + 1, gldim R}.
                   0 S
3.1. Generation and thick subcategories. We recall some prop-
erties of generation of triangulated categories (confer [21], [7, Section
4]).
   Let D be a triangulated category, and let E denote a subset of objects
of D. A triangulated category is equipped with a shift operator. If
M ∈ D, the shift of M will be denoted by M[1].
      • A subcategory of C ⊂ D is said to be thick (´paisse) if it is
                                                         e
         closed under isomorphisms, shift, taking cones of morphisms,
         and taking direct summands of objects in C.
      • An object C ∈ D is said to be compact if HomD (C, −) com-
         mutes with direct sums. Let D c ⊂ D denote the subcategory of
         compact objects in D.
      • We deﬁne E to be the smallest thick full subcategory of D
         containing the elements of E.
      • We deﬁne E ⊥ to be the subcategory of D consisting of all objects
         M such that HomD (E[i], M) = 0, for all i ∈ Z and all E ∈ E.
   We say that E generates D if E ⊥ = 0. If D c generates D, then we
say D is compactly generated.
   If D is compactly generated and E ⊂ D c . It’s clear that if E = D c ,
then E generates D. The following theorem tells us that the converse
is also true.
Theorem 3.2 (Ravenel and Neeman [21]. Also see Thm. 2.1.2 in [10]).
Let D be a compactly generated triangulated category. Then a set of
objects E ⊂ D c generates D if and only if E = D c .

       4. Groups, Quotients, and Associated Sheaves
  We brieﬂy summarize some deﬁnitions and properties of linear alge-
braic groups, which we will need in the paper. Some references for this
section are [11], [15, I.5], [23], and [17, Chapter 24].
A DERIVED EQUIVALENCE FOR SOME TWISTED PROJECTIVE HOMOGENEOUS VARIETIES
                                                                      5

  Let G denote a split, semisimple linear algebraic group over F , and
T ⊂ G a ﬁxed maximal torus. The group Lie(T )∗ := Hom(T, Gm ) will
denote the character lattice of G. It is a free Z-module of ﬁnite rank.
The set R ⊂ Lie(T )∗ will denote a root system corresponding to T , R+
the set of positive roots, and R− := −R+ the set of negative roots, and
the set S = {α1 , . . . , αr } ⊂ R+ is a basis of simple roots.
  For α ∈ Lie(T )∗ , let Lie(G)α denote the eigenspace of Lie(G) corre-
sponding to α. The Lie subalgebra
                          Lie(T )          Lie(G)α
                                    α∈R+

is Lie(B) for a ﬁxed Borel subgroup B of G determined by T and S.
If I ⊂ S, then the Lie subalgebra
                       Lie(B) ⊕                Lie(G)α ,
                                    α∈R− (I)

where
  R− (I) := {α ∈ R− | α = Σr ai αi with ai ≤ 0, ai = 0 ∀ αi ∈ I},
                           i=1

is Lie(PI ), for a unique parabolic subgroup PI ⊃ B of G. Every such
parabolic subgroup (intermediate between B and G) arises in this fash-
ion. For example, P∅ = G and PS = B.
   Let {λ1 , . . . , λr } be the set of fundamental weights determined by
the simple roots αi , and Λ =: Z[λi ] be the weight lattice. If PI is a
parabolic subgroup of G, then we say a weight λ is dominant for PI if
               λ = Σi∈I ni λi + Σj ∈I nj λj , where nj ≥ 0.
                                   /

Also, let ρ = Σi λi .
   The Weyl group W is the group generated by the simple reﬂections sα
corresponding to α ∈ S. For w ∈ W , the length of w is the least number
of factors in a decomposition of w as a product of simple reﬂections.
There is an an action of W on the weight lattice Λ. We will need
another action, called the dot or aﬃne action on Λ:
                         w.λ := w(λ + ρ) − ρ.
We say that a weight λ is singular if there is some non-trivial w ∈ W
such that w.λ = λ.
  If P ⊂ G is a parabolic subgroup, there exists a decomposition, called
the Levi decomposition, of P into a semisimple or Levi factor LP and a
unipotent subgroup Ru (P ). If φ : P → GL(V ) is an irreducible ﬁnite-
dimensional representation, Ru (P ) acts trivially, and so φ descends to a
representation of the Levi factor LP . Each such representation posses
a unique highest weight λ ∈ Λ which determines the representation.
6                              MARK BLUNK

Moreover this weight is dominant for P . For a weight λ, we will denote
the corresponding representation vector space by V (λ).
  Finally, if φ : P → GL(V ) is as in previous paragraph, with corre-
sponding weight λ, then we deﬁne a locally free sheaf of rank dim(V )
on the projective homogeneous variety G/P as follows:
    G ×r V := G × V /{(g, v) ∼ (gp−1, φ(p)(v)) | p ∈ P, g ∈ G, v ∈ V }.
The projection G × V → G induces a map G ×r V → G/P , deﬁning a
vector bundle over G/P . The corresponding locally free sheaf on G/P
will be denoted OG/P (λ). A section of this sheaf can be thought of as
a function F : G → V satisfying F (gp) = φ(p−1 )F (g).
   Let us recall the celebrated Borel-Weil-Bott theorem, which relates
representations on P to the cohomology of the induced sheaf on the
variety G/P .
Theorem 4.1 (Theorem 5.0.1 of [4]). Let G be a simply connected
split semisimple algebraic group, P ⊂ G be a parabolic subgroup, and
λ ∈ Λ is dominant with respect to P . Consider the corresponding sheaf
OG/P (λ) on G/P . Then:
      a If λ is singular,
                       H r (G/P, OG/P (λ)) = 0, ∀r.
       b If λ is not singular, then there exists a unique w ∈ W such that
         w.λ is dominant. Moreover,
                      H i (G/P, OG/P (λ)) = 0, i = l(w)
                    H l(w) (G/P, OG/P (λ)) = V (w.λ).

                     5. Severi-Brauer Varieties
   We recall some well known facts about central simple algebras (confer
[1] and [17, Section I.1.B]). Let A be a central simple algebra over F of
degree n. The algebra A has dimension over F equal to n2 , has no non-
trivial two sided ideals, and center equal to F . Equivalently, A ⊗F F
is isomorphic to EndF (V ′ ), for some F -vector space V ′ of dimension
n. The algebraic group SL1 (A) is of type An . Every ﬁnitely generated
right A-module has dimension, as an F -vector space, divisible by n,
and we deﬁne the reduced dimension of M by
                                      dimF (M)
                         rdimA (M) :=            .
                                           n
Finally, we say that the algebra A is split if A = EndF (V ), where V is
a ﬁnite dimensional F -vector space.
A DERIVED EQUIVALENCE FOR SOME TWISTED PROJECTIVE HOMOGENEOUS VARIETIES
                                                                      7

   Let X := SB(A) be the Severi-Brauer variety of the algebra A. This
is an irreducible, smooth, projective variety of dimension n − 1, whose
points consist of right ideals of A which have reduced dimension 1. If
E/F is a ﬁeld extension, SB(A)E = SB(A⊗F E). When A = EndF (V )
for some F -vector space V of dimension n, every right ideal of A of
reduced dimension 1 is determined by a unique 1-dimensional subspace
of V . Thus SB(EndF (V )) = P(V ). In particular, Since P (V ) = G/P
for G = SL(V ) and P = Pα1 the stabilizer of a line in V , we see that
SB(A) is a twisted form of a projective homogeneous variety.
   We deﬁne the ‘tautological’ sheaf I on X (confer [1], [22, section
10.2]), a subsheaf of the consist sheaf A. The ﬁber over a closed point
x ∈ X(F ) consists of the elements a ∈ AF such that a ∈ x ⊂ AF (here x
is a right ideal of AF of reduced dimension 1). This deﬁnes a locally free
sheaf of rank n on X. This sheaf I is locally free, and has an induced
right A action, and the algebra End(I) is isomorphic to the algebra A.
Finally, If A = EndF (V ) is split, then I = OP(V ) (−λ1 ) ⊗F V ∗ .
   Finally, let
                    T = OX ⊕ I 1 ⊕ I 2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ I ⊗(n−1) .
We will show that T is a tilting sheaf for X.
Theorem 5.1. The sheaf T has no self extensions, i.e.,
                       RHomDb (Coh(X)) (T [i], T ) = 0,
for i > 0.
Proof. It suﬃces to extend scalars to F , so we may assume that F is
separably closed. In this case, X = P(V ), and the sheaf T decomposes
into a sum of invertible sheaves of the form OP(V ) (−jλ1 ), where j =
0, 1, . . . , n − 1.
   So it suﬃces to show that
         RHomDb (Coh(P(V ))) (OP(V ) (−j1 λ1 )[i], OP(V ) (−j2 λ1 )) = 0,
for i > 0 and j1 , j2 = 0, . . . n − 1. But
          RHomDb (Coh(P(V ))) (OP(V ) (−j1 λ1 )[i], OP(V ) (−j2 λ1 )) =
                         Exti ) (OP(V ) (−j1 λ1 ), OP(V ) (−j2 λ1 )) =
                            P(V

                               H i (P(V ), OP(V ) ((j1 − j2 )λ1 )) = 0,
for −n < j1 − j2 ≤ n and i > 0. This follows from Theorem 4.1, since
the corresponding weight in each case is either dominant or singular.
8                                MARK BLUNK

Remark 5.2. Also, note that
      HomP(V ) (OP(V ) , OP(V ) (−iλ1 )) = H 0 (P(V ), OP(V ) (−iλ1 )) = 0,
since the weight −iλ1 is singular when 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. We will need
this in the proof of Theorem 5.3.
Theorem 5.3. The algebra End(T ) has ﬁnite global dimension.
Proof. We prove by induction on n. The base case n = 1 is trivial, as
the ﬁeld F = End(Opt ) has global dimension 0.
                  n−1
   Because T = ⊕i=0 I ⊗i , we have the following matrix presentation
for End(T ) (by Remark 5.2, this matrix is lower triangular).

  By induction, the ring R has ﬁnite global dimension, and in partic-
ular, pdimR (B) is ﬁnite. Since A⊗ (n − 1) is semisimple, we have by
Proposition 3.1 that gldim(EndX (T )) = max{pdimR (B)+1, gldim(R)},
and we conclude that EndX (T ) has ﬁnite global dimension.
Lemma 5.4. Assume that the algebra A is split. The sheaf T generates
D(Qcoh(SB(A)), and T = D b (Coh(SB(A))).
Proof. Since A = EndF (V ) is split, SB(A) = P(V ), and I = OP(V ) (−λ1 )⊗
V ∗ . The sheaf OP(V ) (−iλ1 ) is a summand of T , for i = 0, · · · = n − 1.
By [5] (or [16, Section 3]), we know that these invertible sheaves form
A DERIVED EQUIVALENCE FOR SOME TWISTED PROJECTIVE HOMOGENEOUS VARIETIES
                                                                      9

a strong exceptional collection on P(V ). In particular,
            OP(V ) (−iλ1 ) 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1              = D b (Coh(P(V ))).
This forces T = D b (Coh(P(V ))), and hence the sheaf T generates
D(Qcoh(P(V ))).
Proposition 5.5. The sheaf T generates D(Qcoh(SB(A))).
Proof. Let M ∈ D(Qcoh(SB(A))) and assume that
                   RHomD(Qcoh(SB(A))) (T , M) = 0.
Since T is locally free, Hom(T , −) and T ∗ ⊗ − are exact functors on
                                            ∗
Qcoh(X). (Similarly for Hom(T , −) and T ⊗ − on Qcoh(X).) Thus,
for example, RHomX (T , M) can be computed on D(Qcoh(X)) by
applying Hom(T , −) to each individual term in M.
   Consider the following cartesian square:
                     SB(A)F            v
                                                 /   SB(A) .
                       q                               q
                                                          
                     Spec(F )          u
                                             /       Spec(F )

Since u (and thus v) is ﬂat, it follows that the natural map
                                u∗ Rp∗ → Rq∗ v ∗
is an isomorphism of functors (see [14, (3.18)]).

             0 = u∗(RHomX (T , M))
              = u∗Rp∗ RHomX (T , M) By [14], page 85
              = Rq∗ v ∗ RHomX (T , M)
              = Rq∗ v ∗ (T ∨ ⊗L M)
                              X
                        ∨
              = Rq∗ (T ⊗L v ∗ M)
                        X
              = Rq∗ RHomX (v ∗ T , v ∗M)
              = RHomX (v ∗ T , v ∗M).
  The algebra AF splits, and thus v ∗ T = T generates D(Qcoh(X)),
by Lemma 5.4. This implies that v ∗ (M) = 0. Since v is ﬂat, this forces
M = 0. Hence, T generates D(Qcoh(X)).
  We conclude by collecting our results to prove the main theorem of
this section.

Theorem 5.6. The map
        R Hom(T , −) : D b (Coh(X)) → D b (End(T ) −       mod )
is an equivalence of categories.
Proof. The sheaf T generates D(Qcoh(X)) by Proposition 5.5, and
since D(Qcoh(X)) is compactly generated, it follows that T = D b (Coh(X))
by Theorem 3.2. The sheaf T has no-self extensions by Theorem 5.1.
The algebra A = End(T ) has ﬁnite global dimension, by Theorem
5.3. So T is a tilting sheaf, and the theorem follows from [3, Theorem
3.1.2].
Remark 5.7. In [6], the author produces a semi-orthogonal decomposi-
tion for the derived category of a Severi-Brauer scheme over the derived
category of the base, by producing a collection of twisted sheaves which
satisfy the necessary properties. In the case where the base is Spec(F ),
this is equivalent to result here, since the twisting data comes from a
Brauer class, i.e. the central simple algebra A.

           6. Generalized Severi-Brauer Varieties
   As in the previous section, let A be a central simple algebra of degree
n. Let X = SB(r, A) be the Generalized Severi-Brauer Variety, for
some 0 < r < n. The points of X are the right ideals I ⊂ A of
reduced dimension r. Obviously, SB(1, A) is just the usual Severi-
Brauer variety.
   Let I be the tautological sheaf of SB(r, A), deﬁned in an analogous
fashion to the sheaf in Section 5. This is a locally free sheaf of rank
rn. When A = End(V ) is split, SB(r, A) = SL(V )/Pαr , and I =
OG/P (−λr ) ⊗ V ∗ . Let
                            T =        Σa (I).
                                   a
Here a = (a1 , . . . , ar ) ∈ Nr , subject to the condition n ≥ a1 ≥ a2 ≥
· · · ≥ ar ≥ 0 (that is, Young diagrams with at most n − r rows and
at most r columns) and Σ is the Schur Functor corresponding to a.
Finally, let d(a) = a1 + · · · + an .
Theorem 6.1. The sheaf T has no self extensions.
Proof. The proof is the same as in the proof of Theorem 5.1. The only
diﬀerence is that the weight that appears in the argument is λr , instead
of λ1 .
Theorem 6.2. The ring End(T ) has ﬁnite global dimension.
A DERIVED EQUIVALENCE FOR SOME TWISTED PROJECTIVE HOMOGENEOUS VARIETIES
                                                                     11

Proof. The ring End(T ) is upper triangular, with diagonal entries of
the form Ad(a) , which are all semisimple. The proof follows as in the
proof of 5.3.
Proposition 6.3. The sheaf T generates D(Qcoh(X)), and hence
 T = D b (Coh(X)).
Proof. It suﬃces to show that T generates D(Qcoh(X)) in the case
where A is split. In that case, T contains terms of the form Σa (OG/Pαr (−λr )).
In [16, Theorem 3.4], it is shown that these sheaves form a strong ex-
ceptional collection for G/Pαr . In particular,

                Σa (OG/Pαr (−λr )), a   = D b (Coh(G/Pαr )).

It follows that T generates D(Qcoh(X)), and by Theorem 3.2, T =
D b (Coh(X)).
Theorem 6.4. The sheaf T is a tilting bundle, and thus
        RHom(T , −) : D b (Coh(X)) → D b ( mod − End(T ))
is an equivalence of derived categories.
Proof. The sheaf T has no self-extensions by Theorem 6.1, T =
D ( Coh(X)) by Proposition 6.3, and the algebra End(T ) has ﬁnite
global dimension by PROPOSITION 6.3. Thus T is a tilting sheaf,
and the result follows by 2.1.

                      7. Involution Varieties
  In this section we assume that char(F ) = 2.
  Let (A, σ) be a central simple algebra of degree 2n, equipped with
an orthogonal involution σ. Recall ([17, Proposition 2.6] that σ is
orthogonal if
                                        2n(2n + 1)
                     dimF Sym(A, σ) =              ,
                                             2
                                        2n(2n − 1)
                    dimF Skew(A, σ) =              .
                                             2
Let X := I(A, σ) be the involution variety of A (confer [20], [24]). This
is a codimension 1 subvariety of SB(A), whose points consists of the
right ideals I ∈ SB(A) which are orthogonal, i.e. σ(I) · I = 0. We will
let I ∈ Coh(I(A, σ)) to denote the pullback of the tautological bundle
of SB(A) to I(A, σ).
   Recall from that introduction that Γ = Gal(F /F ). If F is a sheaf
for the ´tale topology, we have the Hochschild-Serre Spectral Sequence:
        e
12                                 MARK BLUNK

[1, Section 2]
                        H p (Γ, H q (Y , F )) → H p+q (Y, F ).
If Y = SB(A), then Y = P(V ′ ) for some vector space V ′ over F .
By looking at the edge terms of the spectral sequence, we have the
following exact sequence:
                                                         f
                   0 → Pic(SB(A)) → Pic(P(V ′ ))Γ − Br(F ).
                                                  →
Here Pic(P(VF ))Γ = ZΓ = Z, generated by the invertible sheaf OP(VF ) (−λ1 ).
The map f sends OP(VF ) (λ1 ) to the class of A in the Brauer group
Br(F ). Since A has an orthogonal involution σ, the exponent of A
divides 2. It follows that OP(VF ) (−2λ1 ) ∈ Ker(f ) descends to an in-
vertible sheaf on SB(A). Restricting to X, we get an invertible sheaf
which we will label OX (−2λ1 ).
   Let C(A, σ) denote the Cliﬀord Algebra associated to the pair (A, σ)
(confer [17, II.8.7]). Since C(A, σ) is deﬁned as a quotient of the tensor
algebra of A, there exists a canonical F -linear map c : A → C(A, σ)
(confer [17, (II.8.13)]).
   We deﬁne a subsheaf J of the constant sheaf C(A, σ) on I(A, σ).
If I ∈ I(A, σ) is an isotropic right ideal of reduced dimension 1, then
the ﬁber over I is the right ideal of C(A, σ) generated by c(I). The
endomorphism ring EndX (J ) is isomorphic to C(A, σ)
Remark 7.1. If A = End(V ) for some ﬁnite dimensional vector space
V over F , then σ = σq is the adjoint involution with respect to some
non-singular quadratic form q ∈ S 2 (V ∗ ). In this case, The isomorphism
SB(End(V )) = P(V ) identiﬁes I(End(V ), σq ) with the quadric Z(q).
Also, if q is maximally isotropic (i.e. there exists an isotropic subspace
of dimension n in V ), then I(End(V ), σq ) = G/P , where G = Spin(q)
is a split group of type Dn , and P = Pα1 . So I(A, σ) is a twisted
projective homogeneous variety. We say that (A, σ) is split if A =
End(V ) and σ = σq , where q is maximally isotropic. Finally, when
                                          ∗                       ∗
X = G/P , J = OG/P (−λn−1 ) ⊗F W+ ⊕ OG/P (−λn ) ⊗F W− , where
W+ = V (−λn−1 ) and W− = V (−λn ), the two half-spin representation
spaces associated to the weights −λn−1 and −λn (confer [22, page 574]).
     Let
           n−2
T :=             OX (−2λ1 )⊗i ⊕ I ⊗ OX (−2λ1 )⊗i             J ⊗ OX (−2λ1 )⊗(n−1) .
           i=0

We will show that T is a tilting bundle for I(A, σ).
Proposition 7.2. The sheaf T generates D(Qcoh(X))
A DERIVED EQUIVALENCE FOR SOME TWISTED PROJECTIVE HOMOGENEOUS VARIETIES
                                                                     13

Proof. This is similar to the proof of Proposition 5.5. We ﬁrst check
that the proposition is true in the split case, where the argument is
similar to Lemma 5.4. So we may assume that A = EndF (V ) and
σ = σq for a maximally isotropic quadratic form q ∈ S 2 (V ∗ ), I(A, σ) =
Z(q) = Spin(q)/Pα1 . The sheaf T decomposes into a sum with terms
OG/P (−iλ), OG/P (−2(n − 1)λ1 − λn−1 ) and OG/P (−2(n − 1)λ1 − λn ),
where 0 ≤ i ≤ 2n − 3. It is shown in [16, section 4] that these sheaves
form a strong exceptional collection. In particular,

 OG/P (−iλ1 ), OG/P (−(2n − 2)λ1 − λn−1 ), OG/P (−(2n − 2)λ1 − λn ),
                                                       = D b (Coh(Z(q))).
Thus we conclude that T generates D(Qcoh(X)) in the split case. The
arbitrary case follows by extending scalars to F , and reasoning as in
Proposition 5.5.
Theorem 7.3. The sheaf T has no self-extensions.
Proof. We extend scalars to F , arguing as in Theorem 5.1. The sheaf T
decomposes into a sum of sheaves with terms OG/P (−(2n−2)λ1 −λn−1 ),
OG/P (−(2n − 2)λ1 − λn ), and OX (jλ1 ), where −(2n − 2) < j ≤ 0. So
it suﬃces to check that
                           H i (X, OX (±jλ1 )) = 0,
                       H i (X, J1∗ ⊗ OX (jλ1 )) = 0,
                     H i (X, J1 ⊗ OX (−jλ1 )) = 0,
                       H i (X, J2∗ ⊗ OX (jλ1 )) = 0,
                     H i (X, J2 ⊗ OX (−jλ1 )) = 0,
                             H i (X, J1 ⊗ J2∗ ) = 0,
                             H i (X, J2 ⊗ J1∗ ) = 0,
for i > 0 and −(2n − 2) < j ≤ 0.
   The highest weights of the corresponding P -representations for these
sheaves are, respectively,
                                       ±jλ1 ,
                             ±(−λn + jλ1 ),
                           ±(−λn−1 + jλ1 ),
                              ±(λn−1 − λn ).
14                           MARK BLUNK

All of these weights are either singular or dominant. Thus by Theorem
4.1, all of the non-zero cohomology above vanishes.
Remark 7.4. As in the Severi-Brauer case, all of the weights jλi are
singular for j < 0, so H 0 (X, OX (jλ1 )) = 0. It follows that we have
the following upper triangular presentation of the global endomorphism
rings End(T ) :
                          F ∗ ∗ ∗ ···               ∗

As in the Severi-Brauer case, we see that End(T ) is upper triangular,
with the Tits Algebras appearing along the diagonal terms.
Theorem 7.5. The ring End(T ) has ﬁnite global dimension.
Proof. The proof follows the same line of reasoning as in Theorem 5.3,
since all diagonal terms are semisimple algebras.
Theorem 7.6. The sheaf T induces a natural equivalence
        RHom(T , −) : D b (Coh(X)) → D b (    mod − End(T )).
Proof. We need to verify that T is a tilting sheaf. It has no self ex-
tensions by Theorem 7.3. By Proposition 7.2 and Theorem 3.2, we see
that T = D b (Coh(X)). The ring End(T ) has ﬁnite global dimension
by Theorem 7.5, and so the statement follows from Theorem 2.1.


                             8. K-theory
   In each case discussed above, the ring End(T ) has an upper trian-
gular presentation, with the Tits Algebras of the corresponding simply
connected linear algebraic group appearing along the diagonal. Thus
in each case, End(T ) a nilpotent ideal I, consisting of the strictly up-
per triangular terms. By applying the K-theory functor (confer [25,
Theorem 1.98]) to the natural equivalences found in Theorems 5.6, 6.4,
and 7.6, we can express the Quillen K-theory of each variety as sum
of the K-theory of the algebras appearing along the diagonal. The
K-theory is not aﬀected if we replace End(T ) by End(T )/I, and we
recovers results found in [22, 10.2, 10.3].

                                                                             MARK BLUNK

                                                Abstract. We give a characterization of all del Pezzo surfaces of degree
                                                6 over an arbitrary ﬁeld F . A surface is determined by a pair of separable
                                                algebras. These algebras are used to compute the Quillen K-theory of the
                                                surface. As a consequence, we obtain an index reduction formula for the
                                                function ﬁeld of the surface.



                                                                          1. Introduction
                                            If X is an algebraic variety deﬁned over an arbitrary ﬁeld F , a common
                                         method (cf. the introduction of [13]) for learning various properties of X is
                                         to ﬁrst study X := X ×Spec F Spec(F ), the extension of scalars of X to a
                                         separable closure F of F , and then to study the action of the Galois group
                                         Gal(F /F ) on algebraic groups and other algebraic objects associated to X.
                                         This is particularly useful when dealing with a class of varieties that all be-
                                         come isomorphic over F , e.g. Severi-Brauer varieties or involution varieties.
                                         A Severi-Brauer variety is determined by a central simple F -algebra A, and
                                         an involution variety is determined by a central simple F -algebra A with an
                                         orthogonal involution of the ﬁrst kind (A, σ). In either case this algebraic data
                                         determines geometrical and topological information about the corresponding
                                         variety. In particular the Quillen K-groups of the variety are determined the
                                         algebra in the Severi-Brauer example, and the algebra with involution in the
                                         involution variety example. This was proved for Severi-Brauer varieties and
                                         involution varieties in [8] and [11], respectively. Panin proved in [7] a more
                                         general theorem computing the K-theory of projective homogeneous varieties,
                                         which contains both examples as special cases. In all of these examples, as in
                                         this paper, the action of algebraic groups plays a signiﬁcant role. An imme-
                                         diate consequence of this computation of the K-theory is an index reduction
                                         formula, which determines how extending scalars of a division F -algebra to
                                         the function ﬁeld of the variety reduces the index of the algebra. In this paper
                                         we will study del Pezzo surfaces of degree 6 over F , obtaining similar results.
                                            A del Pezzo surface S is a smooth projective surface over a ﬁeld F such
                                                                            −1
                                         that the anti-canonical bundle ωS is ample. The degree (the self-intersection
                                         number of ωS ) of any such surface can be any integer between 1 and 9. Such
                                         varieties were discussed in [1], [2], and [12]. As mentioned in some of these
                                         references, a del Pezzo surface of degree 6 is a toric variety for a particular two
                                         dimensional torus, which we will describe below. We explore this toric struc-
                                         ture in Section 2. The result is Theorem 2.4, a classiﬁcation of all such surfaces
                                                                                    1

up to isomorphism preserving the action of the torus. Section 3 contains the
main result of the paper, Theorem 3.5, where it is proved that a del Pezzo
surface of degree 6 is determined by a pair B and Q of separable F -algebras,
with centers K and L ´tale quadratic and cubic over F respectively, and both
                        e
containing K ⊗F L as a subalgebra. Moreover, corK/F (B) and corL/F (Q) must
be split. As an immediate corollary of Theorems 2.4 and 3.5, we give a nec-
essary and suﬃcient condition in terms of B and Q for determining when the
corresponding surface will have a rational point.
   In Section 4, we relate the algebras B and Q to the endomorphism rings of
locally free sheaves on the associated del Pezzo surface S. These sheaves are
used in Theorem 4.2 to relate the Quillen K-theory of S to that of B and Q,
by showing that the algebra A = F × B × Q is isomorphic to S in a certain
K-motivic category C, constructed in [7]. This implies that for all n,
                 Kn (S) ∼ Kn (A) = Kn (F ) ⊕ Kn (B) ⊕ Kn (Q).
                         =
As a corollary we obtain an index reduction formula for the function ﬁeld of
S.
   I would like to thank my advisor Alexander Merkurjev, who posed this
question to me, and answered several of my questions which developed along
the way.
   We use the following notations and conventions:
   An F -variety is a separated scheme of ﬁnite type over Spec(F ).
   F will denote a separable closure of F .
   An F -algebra A is separable if A ⊗F L is semisimple for every ﬁeld extension
L of F . Such an algebra is Azumaya over its center, which is an ´tale extension
                                                                  e
of F .
   Γ will denote the group Gal(F /F ).
   For any F -variety X and any ﬁeld extension E of F , we will denote X ×Spec F
Spec(E) (resp. X ×Spec F Spec(F )) by XE (resp. X).
   For any separable F -algebra A and any ´tale extension E of F , we will
                                                e
denote A ⊗F E (resp. A ⊗F F ) by AE (resp. A).
   If D is a Cartier divisor on a variety X, L(D) will denote the corresponding
invertible sheaf on X.
   For any variety X and any separable algebra A, P(X; A) will denote the
exact category of left A ⊗F OX -modules which are locally free OX -modules.
We will denote P(X; F ) (resp. P(Spec F ; A)) by P(X) (resp. P(A)).
   For any integer n, Kn (X; A) will denote the Quillen group Kn (P(X; A)).
As above, we will denote Kn (X; F ) by Kn (X) and Kn (Spec F ; A) by Kn (A).
   For any algebraic torus T , T will denote the Γ-module of characters HomF (T , Gm,F ).

                              2. Toric Varieties
   We ﬁrst recall from [4], [5], and [12] some basic properties of the variety
S, the blow up of P2 at the 3 non-collinear points [1 : 0 : 0], [0 : 1 : 0], and
[0 : 0 : 1]. The variety S can be realized as a closed subvariety of P2 ×P2 , deﬁned
        DEL PEZZO SURFACES OF DEGREE 6 OVER AN ARBITRARY FIELD                                                3

by the equations x0 y0 = x1 y1 = x2 y2 . The projection onto the ﬁrst factor of P2
is the blow down of the three lines m0 = {x1 = x2 = 0}, m1 = {x0 = x2 = 0},
and m2 = {x0 = x1 = 0}. Similarly, the projection onto the second factor of
P2 is the blow down of the three lines l0 = {y1 = y2 = 0}, l1 = {y0 = y2 = 0},
and l2 = {y0 = y1 = 0}.

Proposition 2.1. Let S be the blow up of P2 at the three points [1 : 0 : 0],
[0 : 1 : 0], and [0 : 0 : 1].

      i. The variety S is a del Pezzo surface of degree 6 over F , and if F is sep-
         arably closed, any del Pezzo surface S of degree 6 over F is isomorphic
         to S.
     ii. The group CH1 (S) is generated by the lines l0 , l1 , l2 , m0 , m1 , and m2 .
    iii. The intersection pairing on CH1 (S) is determined by the following re-
         lations: li = −1, m2 = −1, li mj = 1, and li mi = li lj = mi mj = 0, for
                   2
                                i
         distinct i, j ∈ {0, 1, 2}.
    iv. The group CH2 (S) is cyclic, generated by the class of any rational point.


  As mentioned in [1], there is an action of the torus T = G3 /Gm on P2 ,
                                                            m
described by:

     (t0 , t1 , t2 ) · [x0 , x1 , x2 ; y0 , y1, y2 ] = [t0 x0 , t1 x1 , t2 x2 ; t−1 y0 , t−1 y1 , t−1 y2 ].
                                                                                 0        1        2


Here Gm embeds into G3 diagonally. This action sends S to itself, and is
                            m
faithful and transitive on the open subset U of S, the complement of the
subvariety deﬁned by the equation x0 x1 x2 y0 y1 y2 = 0. This closed subvariety
has 6 irreducible components, the lines l0 , l1 , l2 , m0 , m1 , and m2 , which by the
proposition are arranged in a hexagon. Thus S is a T -toric variety, with fan
dual to the hexagon of lines. There is also an action of the symmetric groups S2
and S3 on S. The nontrivial element of S2 acts on P2 ×P2 by interchanging the
xi and yi , and the S3 action on P2 × P2 arises from the diagonal action of S3 on
the coordinates x0 , x1 , x2 and y0 , y1 , y2 . The S2 and S3 actions commute with
each other, and both groups send S ⊂ P2 × P2 to itself. Therefore they induce
an action of S2 × S3 on S, preserving the set of lines l0 , l1 , l2 , m0 , m1 , and
m2 , and thus inducing an isomorphism from S2 × S3 onto the automorphism
group of the hexagon of lines. The torus T is the connected component of the
identity of the algebraic group AutF (S) of automorphisms of S, and S2 × S3
is the group of connected components. The action of S2 × S3 on S deﬁne a
section S2 × S3 → AutF (S), so we have the following split exact sequence of
algebraic groups:

                             1 → T → AutF (S) → S2 × S3 → 1.

  We have another way to realize S as a closed subvariety of a product of
projective spaces. Deﬁne fi : S :→ P1 for i = 0, 1, 2 by

               f0 ([x0 : x1 : x2 ; y0 : y1 : y2 ]) = [x1 : x2 ] or [y2 : y1 ]
               f1 ([x0 : x1 : x2 ; y0 : y1 : y2 ]) = [x2 : x0 ] or [y0 : y2 ]
              f2 ([x0 : x1 : x2 ; y0 : y1 : y2 ]) = [x0 : x1 ] or [y1 : y0 ].

Each fi is well deﬁned, as the two deﬁnitions agree on the overlap, and thus
is a morphism of varieties. These morphisms deﬁne a morphism f : S →
P1 × P1 × P1 . If we denote the bi-homogeneous coordinates of P1 × P1 × P1 by
X0 , X1 , Y0 , Y1 , Z0 , and Z1 , it can be shown that f maps S isomorphically onto
the hypersurface of P1 × P1 × P1 deﬁned by the equation X0 Y0 Z0 = X1 Y1 Z1 .

where m((t0 , t1 ), (t′0 , t′1 ), (t′′ , t′′ )) = (t0 t′0 t′′ , t1 t′1 t′′ ).

   Now let S be a del Pezzo surface of degree 6 over an arbitrary ﬁeld F . Then
S is a del Pezzo surface of degree 6 over F , and thus by Proposition 2.1 is
isomorphic over F to S. So S is an F -form of S. As the six lines of the
hexagon form a full set of exceptional curves in S, the action of Γ on S is
globally stable on the set of lines of the hexagon. Therefore, there is an open
subvariety U whose complement Z is isomorphic over F to the hexagon of
lines. The action of Γ on Z permutes its irreducible components, inducing an
action of Γ on the hexagon.
   Let T denote the connected component of the identity of AutF (S). The
group of connected components G of AutF (S) is an ´tale group scheme: it is the
                                                                              e
group scheme determined (as in Proposition 20.16 of [3]) by the automorphism
group of the hexagon of lines, with continuous Γ-action on this ﬁnite group
as in the previous paragraph. So T is a torus, S is a T -toric variety, with an
open set U which is a T -torsor, and Γ-action on the fan determined by the
´tale group scheme G.
e
   This Γ-action on the hexagon determines a homomorphism γ : Γ → S2 × S3 .
Projecting onto either factor yields cocycles with values in S2 and S3 , and
thus γ determines a pair (K, L), where K and L are ´tale quadratic and cubic    e
extensions of F , respectively. Note that while the fan, dual to the hexagon of
lines, is the same for all del Pezzo surfaces of degree 6 over F , the possible
Γ-actions on the fan are in a one-to-one correspondence with pairs (K, L).
   For a ﬁxed cocycle γ (i.e. a ﬁxed pair (K, L)), we will classify all del Pezzo
surfaces S of degree 6 where the Γ-action on Z ⊂ S is determined by γ.
   We have from [12] the following short exact sequence of Γ-modules:
                      0 → T → Z[KL/F ] → Pic(S) → 0.
Here KL denotes the algebra K ⊗F L, and Z[KL/F ] is the lattice of the six
lines of Z. The homomorphism Z[KL/F ] → Pic(S) takes a line to the corre-
sponding Cartier divisor on S. As described in [1], this short exact sequence
can be extended into the exact sequence
(1)          0 → T → Z[KL/F ] → Z[K/F ] ⊕ Z[L/F ] → Z → 0.
Here Z[L/F ] is the lattice of pairs of opposite lines, and Z[K/F ] is the lattice
of triangles, where each triangle is a triple of skew lines. The homomorphism
Z[KL/F ] → Z[L/F ] sends each line to the pair containing it, and the ho-
momorphism Z[KL/F ] → Z[K/F ] sends each line to the triangle containing
it. The homomorphism Z[K/F ] ⊕ Z[L/F ] → Z is the diﬀerence of the aug-
mentation maps. This sequence induces the following short exact sequence of
Γ-modules:
(2)         0 → T → Z[KL/F ]/Z → Z[K/F ]/Z ⊕ Z[L/F ]/Z → 0.
6                                     MARK BLUNK

where Z embeds into Z[K/F ], Z[L/F ], and Z[KL/F ] diagonally.
                     (1)
   In analogy with RK/F (Gm ) := Ker(NK/F : RK/F (Gm ) → Gm ), we deﬁne the
following algebraic F -groups:
                GL := Ker(NKL/L : RKL/F (Gm ) → RL/F (Gm ))
               GK := Ker(NKL/K : RKL/F (Gm ) → RK/F (Gm ))
These groups are F -tori, dual to the Γ-modules Z[KL/F ]/Z[L/F ] and Z[KL/F ]/Z[K/F ],
where Z[K/F ] and Z[L/F ] are diagonally embedded in Z[KL/F ]. The em-
beddings of RK/F (Gm ) and RL/F (Gm ) into RKL/F (Gm ) induce embeddings
 (1)                      (1)
RK/F (Gm ) → GL and RL/F (Gm ) → GK . The description of T ⊂ S ⊂ P2 × P2
above descends to the following exact sequence:
                               (1)
(3)                       1 → RK/F (Gm ) → GL → T → 1.

Similarly, the description of f (T ) ⊂ P1 × P1 × P1 above descends to
                               (1)
                          1 → RL/F (Gm ) → GK → T → 1.
We will use these sequences in Section 4.
 Finally, from (1) and (2), we have corresponding sequences of F -tori:
(4)     1 → Gm → RK/F (Gm ) × RL/F (Gm ) → RKL/F (Gm ) → T → 1,
and
                   (1)               (1)    φ      (1)
            1 → RK/F (Gm ) × RL/F (Gm ) − RKL/F (Gm ) → T → 1.
                                        →
Recall that for E = K, L, and KL,
                         (1)
              H 1 (F, RE/F (Gm )) =F × /NE/F (E × )
                         (1)
              H 2 (F, RE/F (Gm )) = Ker(corE/F : Br(E) → Br(F )).
Moreover, as NKL/F (KL)× is a subgroup of NK/F (K× ) and NL/F (L× ), it
follows that the restriction of the homomorphism of H 1 groups induced by φ
to either factor is just factoring out the corresponding subgroup of the quotient,
and thus φ will be surjective. Therefore, by the induced long exact sequence
in cohomology, we obtain the following exact sequence:
        1 → H 1 (F, T ) → Ker(corK/F ) × Ker(corL/F ) → Ker(corKL/F ).
where the last homomorphism sends a pair (x, y) to resKL/K (x) − resKL/L(y) ∈
Br(KL).
  Let C1 be the set of K-algebra isomorphism classes of Azumaya K-algebras
B of rank 9 such that BL = B ⊗K KL and corK/F (B) are split, C2 the set of
L-algebra isomorphism classes of Azumaya L-algebras Q of rank 4 such that
QK = Q ⊗L KL and corL/F (Q) are split, and set C = C1 × C2 . Then C is a
pointed set with distinguished element (M3 (K), M2 (L)), and the map ψ : C →
Ker(corK/F ) × Ker(corL/F ) sending a pair (B, Q) to ([B], [Q]) is a morphism
of pointed sets. Moreover, resKL/K ([B]) = [B ⊗K KL] and resKL/L ([Q]) =
[Q ⊗L KL] are trivial, so it follows that ψ maps into H 1 (F, T ).

Theorem 2.2. ψ : C → H 1 (F, T ) is an isomorphism of pointed sets.
Proof. If ψ(B, Q) = ψ(B ′ , Q′ ), then [B] = [B ′ ] ∈ Ker(corK/F ) ⊂ Br(K). Then
B and B ′ are similar Azumaya K-algebras of the same rank, and thus must
be isomorphic as K-algebras. Similarly, Q and Q′ are isomorphic, so that ψ is
injective.
   Now let (x, y) ∈ H 1 (F, T ), so that (x, y) ∈ Ker(corK/F ) × Ker(corL/F ), and
resKL/K (x) = resKL/L (y). This implies that
              3x = corKL/K (resKL/K (x))
                 = corKL/K (resKL/L(y)) = resK/F (corL/F (y)) = 0.
Similarly, 2y = 0. Thus resKL/K (x) = resKL/L(y) has order divisible by 2 and
3, and therefore is trivial. If L is not a ﬁeld, then L = F × E, where E is an
´tale quadratic extension of F . Then resKL/K (x) = (x, resE⊗F K/K (x)), and so
e
resKL/K (x) = 0 implies x = 0. If L is a ﬁeld, then x is split by a ﬁeld extension
of degree 3 (If K = F × F , and x = (x1 , x2 ) ∈ Br(K) = Br(F ) × Br(F ) is split
by KL if and only if x1 and x2 are split by L). Thus for all possible K and
L, there is an Azumaya K-algebra B of rank 9 that represents x in Br(K).
Since resKL/K (x) and corK/F (x) are trivial, B ⊗K KL and corK/F (B) are split.
Similarly, there is an Azumaya L-algebra Q of rank 4 which represents y such
that Q⊗L KL and corL/F (Q) are split. Then (B, Q) ∈ A, and φ(B, Q) = (x, y),
so ψ is surjective.
Remark 2.3. As KL is an ´tale algebra of degree 3 over K, if KL splits
                                e
B, then KL can be embedded as a subalgebra of B. Similarly, KL can be
embedded as a subalgebra of Q. If (B, Q) = (B ′ , Q′ ) in C = H 1 (F, T ), then any
K-isomorphism from B to B ′ sends KL ⊂ B to a subalgebra of B ′ isomorphic
to KL. Moreover, if we choose a ﬁxed embedding of KL into both B and B ′ ,
by applying Skolem-Noether to B ′ we can ﬁnd an isomorphism from B to B ′
which restricts to the identity on KL. Similarly, we may assume that Q to Q′
are isomorphic via an isomorphism which is the identity on KL.
   It follows that if K and L are ´tale quadratic and cubic extensions of F
                                     e
respectively, and T is the two dimensional torus induced from K and L as in
the exact sequence (4), then elements of H 1 (F, T ) are determined by triples
(B, Q, KL), where B is an Azumaya K-algebra of rank 9 such that corK/F (B)
is split, Q is an Azumaya algebra over L of rank 4 such that corL/F (Q) is split,
and we have a ﬁxed embedding of KL as a subalgebra into both B and Q.
Two triples (B, Q, KL) and (B ′ , Q′ , KL) will determine the same element of
H 1 (F, T ) if there are KL-algebra isomorphisms from B to B ′ and Q to Q′ .
   If S is a del Pezzo surface of degree 6, and if T is the connected component
of the identity of AutF (S), S is a T -toric variety, with Γ-action on the fan
induced by the Γ-action γ on the connected components of Z, the hexagon
of lines. The T -torsors U ⊂ S is determined by an element of the pointed
set H 1 (F, T ). Two surfaces S and S ′ will be isomorphic as toric varieties
if and only if T and T ′ are isomorphic as algebraic groups, and there is an
8                                 MARK BLUNK

isomorphism from S to S ′ which preserves the action of T ∼ T ′ on S and
                                                               =
S ′ , thus inducing isomorphisms Γ-actions on the fan and isomorphisms of the
T -torsors determining S and S ′ . Thus we have proved the following:
Theorem 2.4. Let S be a del Pezzo surface of degree 6, and T be the con-
nected component of the identity of the group AutF (S). Then S is a T -toric
variety with Γ-invariant fan determined by a pair (K, L) and the T -torsor U
determined by a triple (B, Q, KL). Two triples (B, Q, KL) and (B ′ , Q′ , K ′ L′ )
will describe isomorphic toric varieties if and only if K and L are isomorphic
to K ′ and L′ as F -algebras, (so that T ∼ T ′ ), and there exist KL-algebra
                                            =
isomorphisms from B to B ′ and Q to Q′ .


                           3. The Main Theorem
   We would now like to classify these surfaces up to isomorphism as abstract
varieties. This is less restrictive than isomorphism as toric varieties. We will
see that a del Pezzo surface is still determined by a triple (B, Q, KL), but now
we will allow F -algebra isomorphisms on B and Q, i.e. algebra isomorphisms
which may not ﬁx KL.
   Let S be a del Pezzo surface of degree 6 over F . Then S is a T -toric variety,
where T is the connected component of AutF (S), with the Γ-action on the
fan determining a pair (K, L), and the T -torsor U ⊂ S determining a pair
(B, Q, KL). Let G be the group of connected components of AutF (S). As we
have shown above, G is an ´tale group scheme, determined by the action of Γ on
                            e
the hexagon of lines. In particular, G(F ) = AutF (KL) ∼ AutF (K)×AutF (L).
                                                          =
   Consider the following action of G(F ) on H 1 (F, T ): if (g, h) ∈ AutL (KL) ×
AutK (KL) and (B, Q, KL) ∈ H 1 (F, T ) then g nontrivial sends B to B op , and
sends the embedding i : KL → B to ig : KL → B op , where ig (z) = i(g(z))op ∈
B op . As KL is a cyclic extension of L, Q is a cyclic L-algebra, so there is an
element l ∈ L× such that Q is generated by KL and an element y, subject to
the relations y 2 = l and zy = yσ(z) for every z ∈ KL, where σ ∈ AutL (KL)
is the nontrivial automorphism of KL over L. Such an algebra is denoted
(KL/L, l). Let h act on Q = (KL/L, L) by h · (KL/L, l) = (KL/L, h(l)),
                                               h
and send the embedding KL → Q to KL − KL → (KL, h(l)). As l ∈ L×
                                               →
determines Q = (KL/L, l) up to multiplication by an element of the subgroup
NKL/L (KL)× ⊂ L× , and as AutF (L) takes NKL/L (KL)× to itself, we see
that this action is well deﬁned.
   The orbits of this group action can be described in terms of F -algebra iso-
morphisms on B and Q, as we will show below. We will use the following
proposition several times: We will need the following proposition:
Proposition 3.1 (Proposition 4.18 of [3]). Let (B, τ ) be a central simple F -
algebra of degree n with unitary involution, and let K be the center of B. For
every F -subalgebra L of B which is ´tale of dimension n over F , there exists
                                     e
a unitary involution of B ﬁxing L.

Proposition 3.2. (B ′ , Q′ ) = g · (B, Q) for some g ∈ G(F ) if and only if there
are F -automorphisms φB : B → B ′ and φQ : Q → Q′ such that φB |KL =
φQ |KL = g.
Proof. Assume that (B ′ , Q′ , KL) = g · (B, Q, KL) for some g ∈ G(F ). Any
F -automorphism g of KL can be expressed as the composition of two automor-
phisms, one ﬁxing K and one ﬁxing L. So it suﬃces to consider the separate
cases where K and L are ﬁxed by the automorphism.
    We ﬁrst consider the case where g ﬁxes K, so that B ′ = B. By Skolem-
Noether, there is a K-automorphism φB of B such that φB |KL = g. Now,
Q = (KL/L, l), Q′ = (KL/L, g(l)) and as σ and g commute, g extends to an
F -automorphism φQ from Q to Q′ , by sending KL to KL via g, and y to y ′.
Then φB and φQ agree on KL.
    Now assume that g = σ is the non-trivial L-automorphism of KL, so that
Q = Q and B ′ = B op . As in the previous paragraph, by Skolem-Noether there
  ′

is an L-automorphism φQ of Q such that φQ |KL = g. Moreover, as corK/F (B) is
split and L is an ´tale cubic extension of F , we know by Proposition 3.1 that B
                    e
has a unitary involution τ which is the identity on L. The involution τ deﬁnes
an F -isomorphism φB from B to B op , such that φB |KL = σ = g = φQ |KL.
    Conversely, assume that φB : B → B ′ and φQ : Q → Q′ are F -isomorphisms
such that φB |KL = φQ |KL = g ∈ AutF (KL). As in the arguments above, we
will ﬁrst consider the separate cases where g ﬁx K and L.
    If g ﬁxes L, then φQ is an isomorphism of L-algebras, so that (B ′ , Q, KL) =
(B ′ , Q′ , KL) in H 1 (F, T ). If we restrict φB to the center of B, we get an F -
isomorphism of K. If φ|K is the identity (i.e. g is trivial), then B and B ′ are
isomorphic as K-algebras. If φ|K is not the identity, then by pre-composing
φ with the isomorphism from B op to B induced by any unitary involution τ
ﬁxing L on B, we see that B op and B ′ are isomorphic as K-algebras. In either
case, (B ′ , Q′ , KL) = (B ′ , Q, KL) = g · (B, Q, KL) in H 1 (F, T ).
    Now assume that g ﬁxes K, so that φB : B → B ′ is an isomorphism of K-
algebras, and then (B ′ , Q′ , KL) = (B, Q′ , KL) in H 1 (F, T ). If Q = (KL/L, l),
and if l′ = φQ (l) = g(l), then Q is isomorphic over L to (KL/L, l′ ), and so
(B ′ , Q′ , KL) = (B, Q′ , KL) = g · (B, Q) in H 1 (F, T ).
    Finally, assume that g does not ﬁx K or L. If σ is the nontrivial L-
automorphism of KL, σg does ﬁx K. Moreover, by post-composing φB with
the F -isomorphism φB′ : B ′ → (B ′ )op induced by any unitary involution τ of B ′
ﬁxing L (which exist by Proposition 3.1), we get isomorphisms φB′ ◦ φB : B →
(B ′ )op and φQ : Q → Q′ such that (φB′ ◦ φB )|KL = φQ |KL = σg. Therefore by
our argument in the previous paragraph, σ · (B ′ , Q′ , KL) = ((B ′ )op , Q′ , KL) =
σg · (B, Q, KL) in H 1(F, T ). Acting on both sides of this equation by σ, we
get (B ′ , Q′ , KL) = g · (B, Q, KL).
   The next theorem relates isomorphism classes of del Pezzo Surfaces of degree
6 with G(F )-orbits of H 1 (F, T ). We will need the following standard result
from Galois cohomology: (cf. Corollary (28.10) of [3] or Chapter I, Section
5.5, Corollary 2 of [9].)

Proposition 3.3. Let Γ be a proﬁnite group, A and B be Γ-groups with A a
normal subgroup of B, and set C = B/A. If β ∈ H 1 (Γ, B), and b a cocycle
representing β, then the elements of H 1 (Γ, B) with the same image as β in
H 1 (Γ, C) corresponding bijectively with (Cb )Γ -orbits of the set H 1 (Γ, Ab ).
Theorem 3.4. The isomorphism class of S corresponds to a G(F )-orbit of
H 1 (F, T ).
Proof. As mentioned in Section 2, we have the following split exact sequence
of algebraic groups:
(5)                    1 → T → AutF (S) → S2 × S3 → 1,
where T is the connected component of the identity of AutF (S), and S2 × S3
is the group of connected components. This sequence induces the split exact
sequence of pointed sets:
           1 → H 1 (F, T ) → H 1 (F, AutF (S)) → H 1 (F, S2 × S3 ) → 1.
The elements of H 1 (F, AutF (S)) are in a one-to-one correspondence with the
set of isomorphisms classes of F -forms of S, which by Proposition 2.1 are
del Pezzo surfaces of degree 6. Let β ∈ Z 1 (F, AutF (S)) be a cocycle whose
cohomology class is determined by the isomorphism class of S, and let γ be
the image of β in Z 1 (F, S2 × S3 ). The cocycle γ is determined by the action
of the Galois group Γ on Z ⊂ S, and induces a pair (K, L). The twist of T by
γ is the torus T , determined by (K, L) as in the sequence (4), and the twist of
S2 × S3 is the ´tale group scheme G. The result follows by Proposition 3.3.
               e
   Note that as H 1 (F, AutF (S)) → H 1 (F, S2 × S3 ) is surjective, we see that
all possible pairs (K, L) are realized by the action of Γ on Z, for Z contained
in some del Pezzo surface S of degree 6. So let S1 and S2 be two del Pezzo
surfaces of degree 6, and let (Bi , Qi , Ki Li ) be an element of the the Gi (F )-orbit
of H 1 (F, Ti) determined by Si , for i = 1, 2. Then S1 and S2 induce isomorphic
Γ-actions on the hexagon of lines (so that (K1 , L1 ) ∼ (K2 , L2 ), T1 ∼ T2 , and
                                                           =               =
G1 ∼ G2 ; we denote these algebraic objects (K, L), T , and G, respectively).
    =
It follows from Proposition 3.2 that two pairs (B1 , Q1 , KL) and (B2 , Q2 , KL)
are in the same G(F )-orbit of H 1 (F, T ) if and only if there are isomorphisms
φB1 : B1 → B2 and φQ1 : Q1 → Q2 such that φB1 |KL = φQ1 |KL. We have
proved the following theorem:
Theorem 3.5. There are bijections, inverse to each other, between the follow-
ing two sets:
     • The set of isomorphism classes of del Pezzo surfaces of degree 6.
     • The set of triples (B, Q, KL), modulo the relation: (B, Q, KL) ∼ (B ′ , Q′ , K ′ L′ )
       if there are F -algebra isomorphisms φB : B → B ′ and φQ : Q → Q′
       such that φB |KL = φQ |KL.
  For the rest of this paper, S(B, Q, KL) will denote the del Pezzo surface of
degree 6 determined by the triple (B, Q, KL).

Corollary 3.6. The surface S(B, Q, KL) contains a rational point if and only
if B and Q are split.

Proof. Since S(B, Q, KL) is a T -toric variety for a two dimensional torus T ,
S has a rational point if and only if the corresponding T -torsor U is a trivial
torsor (cf. Proposition 4 of [14]). By Theorem 2.4, this occurs precisely when
B and Q are split.

Remark 3.7. If S0 is a T -toric model (i.e. the T -torsor U ⊂ S0 is trivial), then
the map H 1 (F, T ) → H 1 (F, AutF (S)) induced by T ֒→ AutF (S) takes a T -
torsor U to the surface determined by U and the Γ-action on the fan determined
by the pair (K, L). Thus for any surface S, the elements of H 1 (F, T ) in the
ﬁber of the isomorphism class of S determine the possible non-isomorphic T -
toric structures on S, where T is the connected component of the identity of
the algebraic group AutF (S). In terms of the algebras B and Q, the map
H 1 (F, T ) → H 1 (F, AutF (S)) forgets the KL-algebra structure of B and Q,
preserving only the F -algebra structure and the embedding of KL into B and
Q.
   The group AutF (K) always has order 2, but the group AutF (L) can have
order 1, 2, 3, or 6. If AutF (L) has order less than 6, then the orbit of (B, Q, KL)
in H 1 (F, T ) contains at most 6 elements. It AutF (L) has order 6, then L = F 3
is not a ﬁeld, and thus B is necessarily split. If B is split, then the pair
(B, Q, KL) ∈ H 1 (F, T ) is ﬁxed by the subgroup AutF (K) of G(F ), and so
again the G(F )-orbit of (B, Q, KL) in H 1 (F, T ) has at most 6 elements. Thus
for a del Pezzo surface S of degree 6, there at most 6 non-isomorphic T -toric
structures on S.

Remark 3.8. We would like to relate this characterization of del Pezzo sur-
faces of degree 6 by triples (B, Q, KL) with the characterization by triples
(B, τ, L) found in [1]. A triple (B, τ, L) is an Azumaya K-algebra B of rank
9, a unitary involution τ on B, and a cubic ´tale F -algebra L such that
                                                    e
L ⊂ Sym(B, τ ). Two triples (B, τ, L) and (B , τ , L′ ) are isomorphic if there is
                                               ′  ′

an F -algebra isomorphism φ : B → B ′ such that τ ′ φ = φτ and φ(L) = L′ .
   So let (B, Q, KL) be a triple as in Theorem 3.5. Then B is an Azumaya
K-algebra of rank 9, and is classiﬁed up to isomorphism as an F -algebra. As
BL is split, so B contains KL, and hence L, as a subalgebra. Since corK/F (B)
is split, we know that B has a unitary involution. Moreover, since L is an
´tale cubic extension of F contained in B, there is some unitary involution
e
τ such that L ⊂ Sym(B, τ ), by Proposition 3.1. So the B and L in our
characterization match with the B and L described in [1]. The rest of the
remark seeks to relate Q and the involution τ . That is, we want to classify all
triples (B, τ, L) with B and L ﬁxed. This should correspond to ﬁxing K, L,
and B, and trying to determine all possible Q.
   As K/F and KL/L are cyclic,

                           Br(K/F ) ∼ F × / NK/F (K× )

and
                       Br(KL/L) ∼ L× / NKL/L (KL)× .
                                =
The restriction homomorphism resL/F : Br(F ) → Br(L) sends the subgroup
Br(K/F ) to Br(KL/L). As K and L have coprime degrees, resL/F |Br(K/F ) :
Br(K/F ) → Br(KL/L) is injective, and the cyclic algebra Q corresponds to
an element of Br(KL/L)/ resL/F (Br(K/F )), i.e. an element of

            L× / NKL/L (KL)×       resL/F F × / NK/F (K× )

          = L× / NKL/L (KL)×       F × NKL/L (KL)× / NKL/L (KL)×
          ∼ L× /F × NKL/L (KL)× .
          =

   If τ is a unitary involution on B which is the identity on L, and u ∈ L× ,
then τu := Int(u) ◦ τ is also a unitary involution on B ﬁxing L. Moreover, τu is
conjugate to τv if uv −1 ∈ F × NKL/L (KL)× . Thus, after a choice of a particular
involution τ , we have a morphism of pointed sets from L× /F × NKL/L (KL)×
to the set of conjugacy classes of unitary involutions of B which are the identity
on L, sending u to τu . By Corollary 19.3 of [3], this map is a surjection. So we
have a surjective map from L× /F × NKL/L (KL)× to the set of isomorphism
classes of triples (B, τ, L).
   Theorem 3.5 should say that the ﬁbers of this surjection should be the orbit
of the group AutF (L) in L× /F × NKL/L (KL)× , corresponding to the AutF (L)-
orbit of (B, Q). However, to make this statement correct, we need to choose
a particular involution τ on B. It is not clear in general what this involution
should be. The involution τ should be chosen so that the surface S(B, τ, L)
should correspond to the pair (B, M2 (L)). In particular, if B = M3 (K) is split,
the surface described by the triple (M3 (K), τ, L) should have a rational point,
by Corollary 3.6. The next remark constructs the involution in this case.
Remark 3.9. Given K and L, we will ﬁnd a triple (B, τ, L), (i.e. a central sim-
ple algebra of degree 3 over K with an involution τ such that L ⊂ Sym(B, τ ),)
so that the corresponding del Pezzo surface S(B, τ, L) constructed in [1] has a
rational point.
   As KL is a three dimensional vector space over K, B := EndK (KL) is a
Azumaya K-algebra of rank 9. Left multiplication by an element of KL deter-
mines an embedding of KL into B. If σ is the nontrivial L-automorphism of
KL, h(x, y) = TrKL/K (σ(x)y) deﬁnes a hermitian form on KL. This hermit-
ian form on KL induces an involution of the second kind τ on B, such that
L ⊂ Sym(B, τ ). So we have a triple (B, τ, L). Let S denote the corresponding
del Pezzo surface of 6, constructed in [1].
   I claim that S contains a rational point. According to [1], it suﬃces to
show that there is a right ideal I of B of reduced dimension 1 such that

   Let W = spanK (1) ⊂ LK, so that W is a one dimensional K-subspace of
KL. and then I = HomK (KL, W ) is a right ideal of B of reduced dimension
1, generated by the linear map t = TrKL/K : KL → K ֒→ KL. We want to
show that t ∈ Sym(B, τ ). First, note that for any x ∈ KL, TrKL/K (σ(x)) =
σ(TrLK/L(x)). If x, y ∈ KL,
                      h(x, t(y)) = TrKL/K (σ(x) TrKL/K (y))
                                 = TrKL/K (σ(x)) TrKL/K (y)
                                 = TrKL/K (σ(TrKL/K (x))y)
                                 = h(t(x), y).
So t ∈ Sym(B, τ ), which implies that τ (I) is a left ideal of B, also generated
by t. Thus, I · τ (I) = tBt.
   In order to prove I · τ (I) ∩ Sym(B, τ ) ⊂ F ⊕ L⊥ , it suﬃces to consider the
case where L = F 3 is split. So we can choose a basis e1 , e2 , e3 of idempotents
for KL over K. In this basis, τ is the standard adjoint involution, Sym(B, τ )
is the set of hermitian matrices, and F ⊕ L⊥ is the set of hermitian matrices
where the diagonal entries agree. Moreover, t is the matrix with ones in every
entry, so t ∈ F ⊕ L⊥ . A direct calculation shows I · τ (I) = spanK (t), and hence
(I · τ (I)) ∩ Sym(B, τ ) = spanF (t) ⊂ F ⊕ L⊥ .

                        4. K0 of del Pezzo Surfaces
   Let S = S(B, Q, KL) be a del Pezzo surface of degree 6, a T -toric variety
for a two dimensional torus T . Let Z ⊂ S be the closed variety such that Z
is the union of six lines l0 , l1 , l2 , m0 , m1 , and m2 . Recall the exact sequence
(2) from Section 2, where Z[KL/F ] is the lattice of connected components of
Z ⊂ S, the lines li and mi , and the homomorphism Z[KL/F ] → Pic(S) sends
each line to the corresponding invertible sheaf on S. From the exact sequence
(1), we see that T is the subgroup of Z[KL/F ] generated by l0 −l1 −(m0 −m1 ),
l0 − l2 − (m0 − m2 ), and l1 − l2 − (m1 − m2 ). Note that any one of these 3
generators can be expressed as a linear combination of the other 2. So Pic(S)
is generated by the invertible sheaves L(−li ), L(−mj ), and we have that the
invertible sheaves L(−li − mj ) and L(−lj − mi ) are isomorphic for i, j = 0, 1, 2.
   There is another way to recover these generators and relations, which does
not depend on the theory of toric varieties. Recall that there is a morphism
p1 : S → P2 , obtained by blowing down the lines m0 , m1 , and m2 . If x0 , x1 , x2
are the homogeneous coordinates of P2 and Di = {xi = 0} for i = 0, 1, 2, then
D0 , D1 , and D2 are all linearly equivalent divisors on P2 , and thus their strict
transforms m1 +l0 +m2 , m0 +l1 +m2 , and m0 +l2 +m1 are all linearly equivalent
divisors on S. Therefore the corresponding invertible sheaves L(−m1 −l0 −m2 ),
L(−m0 − l1 − m2 ), and L(−m0 − l2 − m1 ) on S are isomorphic. From this
we can conclude that Pic(S) is generated by the invertible sheaves L(−m0 ),
L(−m1 ), L(−m2 ), L(−m1 −l0 −m2 ), L(−m0 −l1 −m2 ), and L(−m0 −l2 −m1 ),
and we have that L(−li − mj − lk ) and L(−lj − mi − lk ) are isomorphic for any

i, j = 0, 1, 2. This presentation is equivalent to that in the previous paragraph.
Similarly, this presentation can be obtained by considering the morphism p2 :
S → P2 obtained by blowing down the lines l0 l1 , and l2 .
    We deﬁne the following locally free sheaves on S:
      I1 = L(−m1 − l0 − m2 ) ⊕ L(−m0 − l1 − m2 ) ⊕ L(−m0 − l2 − m1 )
      I2 = L(−l1 − m0 − l2 ) ⊕ L(−l0 − m1 − l2 ) ⊕ L(−l0 − m2 − l1 )
     J1 = L(−l0 − m1 ) ⊕ L(−l1 − m0 )
     J2 = L(−l0 − m2 ) ⊕ L(−l2 − m0 )
     J3 = L(−l1 − m2 ) ⊕ L(−l2 − m1 ).
The Γ-action on the hexagon of lines induces an action on the locally free
sheaves I1 ⊕ I2 and J1 ⊕ J2 ⊕ J3, compatible with the action on S. Therefore
I1 ⊕ I2 and J1 ⊕ J2 ⊕ J3 descend to sheaves I and J on S.
    We will consider the following endomorphism rings: B ′ = EndOS (I)op , and
Q = EndOS (I)op . As S is projective, EndOS (OS )op = F , and since I and J
  ′

are OS -modules, it follows that B ′ and Q′ are F -algebras. For i, j, and k not
equal, EndOS (L(−mi − lj − mk )) = EndOS (L(−li − mj − lk )) = F , so we see
       6
that F embeds diagonally into EndOS (I1 ⊕ I2 ). Moreover, since L(−li − mj )
and L(−lj − mi ) are isomorphic for any i, j, I1 ⊕ I2 = (L(−m1 − l0 − m2 ) ⊕
L(−l1 − m0 − l2 )) ⊗F V , where V is an F -vector space of dimension 3. An
element of HomOS (L(−m1 − l0 − m2 ), L(−l1 − m0 − l2 )) is given by a global
section of L(m2 − l2 ). Any non-zero global section of L(m2 − l2 ) would give a
function deﬁned on a neighborhood of l2 ⊂ S with vanishing set l2 . Blowing
down the lines li , this function would then correspond to a function deﬁned
on an open subset of P2 with vanishing set a point, which is impossible, since
a point is a codimension 2 subvariety of P2 . Thus L(m2 − l2 ) has no nonzero
global sections. Similarly HomOS (L(−l1 −m0 −l2 ), L(−m1 −l0 −m2 )) = 0, and
so EndOS (I1 ⊕I2 ) = EndOS (L(−mi −lj −mk )×L(−li −mj −lk ))⊗F EndF (V ) =
                                                               2                 6
EndF 2 (VF 2 ). So the center of EndOS (I1 ⊕ I2 ) is a copy of F , contained in F .
              2      6
This chain F ⊂ F ⊂ EndOS (I1 ⊕ I2 ) descends to K ⊂ KL ⊂ EndOS (I),
with K the center of EndOS (I).
  Now let E be any separable ﬁeld extension of F over which the lines li , mj are
deﬁned. This is equivalent to E splitting both K and L. the above arguments
show that EndOS (I) ⊗F E ≈ M3 (E 2 ), where E 2 ≈ K ⊗F E. Therefore, we
conclude that B ′ is an Azumaya K-algebra of rank 9 which contains KL as
a subalgebra. A similar argument shows that Q′ is an Azumaya L-algebra of
rank 4 which also contains a copy of KL.
Theorem 4.1. B ′ = EndOS (I)op and B are isomorphic as K-algebras. Simi-
larly, Q′ = EndOS (J )op and Q are isomorphic as L-algebras.

Proof. Let S be as in Proposition 2.1, and let I and J be the sheaves associated
to S as above. Twisting I and J by the Γ-action corresponding to the pair

(K, L), we get sheaves I0 and J0 associated to the T -toric model S0 . Let
B0 = EndOS (I0 )op and Q′0 = EndOS (J0)op . The embeddings of KL into B0

   The ﬁrst diagram induces the following commutative diagram of cohomology
sets:

  The left vertical arrow sends the triple (B, Q, KL) to the endomorphism ring
B = End(I)op , where I is the sheaf associated to the surface S(B, Q, KL)
 ′

constructed above. The upper horizontal arrow sends the triple (B, Q, KL) to
the class of [B] ∈ Br(K), which lands in the subgroup of elements of trivial
norm. The right vertical map is the inclusion homomorphism. The lower
horizontal arrow sends a K-algebra to its corresponding element in Br(K).
By the commutativity of the diagram, we see that [B] = [B ′ ] in Br(K). But
these algebras have the same rank, so they must be isomorphic as K-algebras.
A similar argument shows that Q′ = EndOS (J )op and Q are isomorphic as
L-algebras.
   Let A be the separable F -algebra F ×B ×Q, so that P(A) = P(F )×P(B)×
P(Q). Deﬁne the exact functors uF from P(F ) to P(S) by M1 → OS ⊗F M1 ,
uB from P(B) to P(S) by M2 → I ⊗B M2 , and uQ from P(Q) to P(S) by
M3 → J ⊗Q M3 . If we set P = OS ⊕I ⊕J , then the respective right actions of
F , B, and Q on OS , I, and J combine to give a right action of A = F × B × Q
on P. Therefore, we can deﬁne an exact functor from P(A) to P(S) by sending
M to P ⊗A M. This exact functor induces a homomorphism:
                                                                    φ : K0 (A) → K0 (S).
  More generally, if Y is any F -variety, then we have an exact functor from
P(Y ; A) to P(Y × S), sending M to p∗ (P) ⊗OY ×S ⊗F A p∗ (M), where p1 : Y ×
                                       2               1
S → Y and p2 : Y × S → S are the projection morphisms. This induces a
16                                 MARK BLUNK

homomorphism φY : K0 (Y ; A) → K0 (Y × S). Furthermore, if E is any ﬁeld
extension of F , then φ naturally extends to a homomorphism φE : K0 (AE ) →
K0 (SE ).
Theorem 4.2. φ : K0 (A) → K0 (S) is an isomorphism.
   We will prove this in several stages. Let us ﬁrst consider the case where
F is separably closed. By Proposition 2.1, S is isomorphic to the blow up
of the projective plane at the 3 non-collinear points [1 : 0 : 0], [0 : 1 : 0],
and [0 : 0 : 1]. Recall that we have the ﬁltration 0 = K0 (S)(3) ⊂ K0 (S)(2) ⊂
K0 (S)(1) ⊂ K0 (S)(0) = K0 (S) by codimension of support, and homomorphisms
CH i (S) → K0 (S)(i/i+1) , which send the class of a subvariety V to the equiva-
lence class [OV ]. These homomorphisms are isomorphisms for i = 0, 1, 2. So by
Proposition 2.1, if P is a rational point of S, K0 (S) is generated by [OS ], [Ol0 ],
[Ol1 ], [Ol2 ], [Om0 ], [Om1 ], [Om2 ], and [OP ]. Moreover, as CH0 (S), CH1 (S), and
CH2 (S) are free abelian groups with ranks 1, 4, and 1, respectively, K0 (S) is
free abelian with rank 6. Since F is separably closed, K, L, B, and Q are
split, and thus K0 (A) is also free abelian of rank 6. Therefore φ will be an
isomorphism provided it is surjective. So it suﬃces to show that [OS ], [Ol0 ],
[Ol1 ], [Ol2 ], [Om0 ], [Om1 ], [Om2 ], and [OP ] are in the image of φ.
   Clearly, [OS ] = [OS ⊗F F ] is in the image of φ. As F is separably closed,
I = (L(−m1 −l0 −m2 )⊕L(−l1 −m0 −l2 ))⊗F V , where V is an F -vector space of
dimension 3, K = F ×F ∼ EndOS (L(−m1 −l0 −m2 ))×EndOS (L(−l1 −m0 −l2 )),
                              =
and EndOS (I)op ∼ EndF 2 (VF 2 ).
                     =
   Now HomF 2 (VF 2 , F × 0) is a right EndOS (I)-module, and thus a left A-
module, where the F and Q component of A = F × B × Q act trivially.
Therefore,

     φ HomF 2 (VF 2 , F × 0) = I ⊗B HomF 2 (VF 2 , F × 0)

                               =    L(−m1 − l0 − m2 ) ⊕ L(−l1 − m0 − l2 )


                               ⊗F 2 (F × 0)

                               = [L(−m1 − l0 − m2 )],

where we use Morita equivalence in the second line. A mirror argument shows
that φ HomF 2 (VF 2 , 0 × F ) = [L(−l1 − m0 − l2 )], and a similar argument
applied to J and Q shows that [L(−l0 −m1 )], [L(−l0 −m2 )], and [L(−l1 −m2 )]
are in the image of φ.
   Now let i, j ∈ {0, 1, 2} and not equal. By Proposition 2.1, the lines li and
mj have intersection a rational point P of S, with multiplicity 1, the lines mi
and mj are skew, and the lines li and lj are skew. Thus we have the following
resolutions of OP and OS :

  So 0 = [OS ] − [L(−mi )] − [L(−mj )] + [L(−mi − mj )] in K0 (S). If we take
k ∈ {0, 1, 2} not equal to i or j and multiply this equation by [L(−lk )], we see
that
      0 = [L(−lk )] − [L(−lk − mi )] − [L(−lk − mj )] + [L(−mi − lk − mj )].
Therefore,
      [Olk ] = [OS ] − [L(−lk )]
             = [OS ] − [L(−lk − mi )] − [L(−lk − mj )] + [L(−mi − lj − mk )]
is in the image of φ. The same argument with l and m interchanged shows that
[Omk ] is in the image of φ for k ∈ {0, 1, 2}. Finally, [OP ] = [OS ] − [L(−l0 )] −
[L(−m1 )] + [L(−l0 − m1 )] is in the image of φ, and thus φ is surjective when
F is separably closed.
Proposition 4.3. φ : K0 (A) → K0 (S) is an isomorphism if B and Q are
split.
Proof. By the preceding argument, φF : K0 (A) → K0 (S) is an isomorphism.
Moreover, φF commutes with the action of Γ on both K0 (A) and K0 (S), and
thus it descends to an isomorphism on the Γ-invariant subgroups. Therefore,
we have the following commutative diagram:
                                               φ
                                   K0 (A)               /   K0 (S)

                               K0 (A)Γ              /   K0 (S)Γ .

As φF and the left vertical map K0 (A) → K0 (A)Γ are isomorphisms, φ must be
injective. Moreover, if the right vertical map is injective, then φ is surjective,
18                                                                   MARK BLUNK

and hence an isomorphism. So it suﬃces to show that K0 (S) → K0 (S)Γ is
injective.
   To see this, note that the rank and wedge homomorphisms rank : K0 (S) → Z
and ∧ : K0 (S)(1) → Pic(S) commute with the action of Γ. Thus we have the
following short exact sequences of Γ-modules:
                                                                                               ∧

   As B and Q are split, S has a rational point by Corollary 3.6. Thus the
homomorphism K0 (S)2 → (K0 (S)(2) )Γ is a surjective homomorphism of free
abelian groups of rank 1, and therefore an isomorphism. Moreover, the homo-
morphism Pic(S) → Pic(S)Γ is injective. Thus, by applying the Snake Lemma
to the ﬁrst diagram and then to the second, we see that K0 (S) → (K0 (S))Γ is
injective.
Remark 4.4. If P and P ′ are rational points of S, they deﬁne equal classes in
CH2 (S) by Proposition 2.1, and hence [OP ] = [OP ′ ] in K0 (S)(2) . So K0 (S)(2)
is generated by the Γ-invariant element [OP ], and thus is a trivial Γ-module.
Similarly, our arguments above show that the set {[Ol0 ⊕ Om1 ], [Ol0 ⊕ Om2 ],
[Ol1 ⊕ Om2 ], [Om1 ⊕ Ol0 ⊕ Om2 ], [Ol1 ⊕ Om0 ⊕ Ol2 ]} is a Γ-invariant ba-
sis of K0 (S)(1) , and thus K0 (S)(1) is a permutation module. It follows that
H 1 (F, K0 (S)(2) ) = H 1 (F, K0 (S)(1) ) = 0.
     We will need the following proposition (cf. Proposition 6.1 of [6]).
        DEL PEZZO SURFACES OF DEGREE 6 OVER AN ARBITRARY FIELD                                                                                        19

Proposition 4.5. If Y is a variety such that the homomorphism φF (y) :
K0 (AF (y) ) → K0 (SF (y) ) is an isomorphism for every y ∈ Y , then φY : K0 (Y ; A) →
K0 (S × Y ) is surjective.
Proof. We do this by double induction on the dimension of Y and the number
of irreducible components of Y .
   If Y has a proper irreducible component Y ′ , with complement U, we have
the following localization exact sequence (cf. [8]):

              K0 (Y ′ ; A)                             /   K0 (Y ; A)                                 /   K0 (U; A)                          /   0
                           φY ′                                            φY                                               φU
                                                                                                                      
             K0 (Y ′ × S)                  /           K0 (Y × S)                             /       K0 (U × S)                         /       0

By our inductive assumption, the vertical maps on the right and on the left are
surjective. This implies that the middle vertical map is surjective as well. So
we may assume that Y is irreducible. If Y is not reduced, then we the natural
Yred → Y induces the commutative diagram

                                  K0 (Yred ; A)                                     /   K0 (Y ; A)
                                                           φYred                                               φY
                                                                                                          
                                  K0 (Yred × S)                                 /   K0 (Y × S),

where the horizontal arrows are isomorphisms. Thus we may also assume that
Y is reduced.
   Now let x ∈ K0 (Y × S). By assumption, φF (Y ) : K0 (AF (Y ) ) → K0 (SF (Y ) ) is
an isomorphism, and hence there exists an open set U in Y such the image of
x in K0 (U × S) is in the image of φU . We again consider the localization exact
sequence:

              K0 (Z; A)                        /           K0 (Y ; A)                             /       K0 (U; A)                  /           0
                           φZ                                              φY                                               φU
                                                                                                                  
             K0 (Z × S)                /       K0 (Y × S)                                 /       K0 (U × S)                     /               0,

where Z is the complement of U in Y . By assumption, Z has a strictly smaller
dimension than Y , and so by our inductive hypothesis, φZ is surjective. A
standard diagram chase shows that x ∈ Im(φY ).

Proof of Theorem 4.2. Let SB(B) be the Severi-Brauer K-variety associated
to B, SB(Q) be the Severi-Brauer L-variety associated to Q, and Y = RK/F (SB(B))×
RL/F (SB(Q)) be the product of the restriction of scalars of both varieties.
Then for any ﬁeld extension E of F , Y (E) is nonempty if and only if SB(B)(K⊗F
E) and SB(Q)(L ⊗F E) are nonempty if and only if BE = B ⊗K (K ⊗F E)
and QE = Q ⊗L (L ⊗F E) are split.

     The projection p : Y → Spec(F ) induce the following diagram:
                                                  φ
                            K0 (A)                                 /   K0 (S)

                           K0 (Y ; A)                  /   K0 (Y × S),
where pY : Y × S → S is the projection induced by p. Both squares commute,
and p∗ p∗ is the identity homomorphism, as Y is a geometrically rational va-
riety. For every y ∈ Y , Y (F (y)) = ∅, so BF (y) and QF (y) are split, and thus
φF (y) : K0 (AF (y) ) → K0 (SF (y) ) is an isomorphism by Proposition 4.3. So by
Proposition 4.5, φY : K0 (Y ; A) → K0 (Y × S) is surjective. A diagram chase
shows the top horizontal map φ is also surjective.
   Now let E be any ﬁeld extension of F such that S(E) = ∅. Then, BE and QE
are split, and so φE : K0 (AE ) → K0 (SE ) is an isomorphism, again by Propo-
sition 4.3. The homomorphisms φ and φE ﬁt into the following commutative
diagram:
                                                  φ
                              K0 (A)                           /       K0 (S)

                                                 φE
                                                                          
                             K0 (AE )                      /   K0 (SE ),
where the vertical homomorphisms are induced by the inclusion F ⊂ E. The
bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism, and the left vertical map is injective.
It follows that φ is injective, and hence an isomorphism.
   As φ is an isomorphism, the hypothesis on the variety V in Proposition 4.5
is always true, we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 4.6. φV : K0 (V ; A) → K0 (V × S) is surjective for any F -variety
V.

                             5. Higher K-theory
  We have shown that the K0 groups of S and A coincide. We will show that
this is also true for the higher Quillen K-groups.
  For any F -varieties X, Y , and Z, and separable F -algebras A, B, and C,
consider the functor:
      P(Y × Z; B op ⊗F C) × P(X × Y ; Aop ⊗F B) → P(X × Z; Aop ⊗F C),
sending a pair (M, N) to (p13 )∗ (p∗ (M) ⊗B p∗ (N)), where p12 , p23 , and p13 are
                                   23        12
the projections of X × Y × Z onto its factors. This functor is bi-exact, and
thus induces a product map
Kn (Y × Z; B op ⊗F C) ⊗Z Km (X × Y ; Aop ⊗F B) → Kn+m (X × Z; Aop ⊗F C).
We will denote the image of u ⊗ x under this map by u •B x.
  We recall the K-Motivic Category C and some of its properties. The details
can be found in [6] and [7]. Objects of C are pairs (X, A), where X is an
        DEL PEZZO SURFACES OF DEGREE 6 OVER AN ARBITRARY FIELD                 21

F -variety and A is a separable F -algebra. For two pairs (X, A) and (Y, B) in
C, we set MorC ((X, A), (Y, B)) := K0 (X × Y ; Aop ⊗F B). The composition law
is g ◦ f = g •B f , for f : (X, A) → (Y, B) and g : (Y, B) → (Z, C) in C. For any
pair (X, A) with X smooth, the identity element 1(X,A) ∈ K0 (X ×X; Aop ⊗F A)
is the element [O∆ ⊗F A], where ∆ ⊂ X ×X is the diagonal. For any F -variety
X and any separable F -algebra A, we will write X for the pair (X, F ) and
A for the pair (Spec F, A). Finally, for any F -variety V and any nonnegative
                                              V
integer n, we have a realization functor Kn , which sends an object (X, A) to
                           V
Kn (V × X; A), and Kn (f )(x) = f •A x ∈ Kn (V × Y ; B) for any morphism
f ∈ MorC ((X, A), (Y, B)) = K0 (X × Y ; Aop ⊗F B) and x ∈ Kn (V × X; A). We
will denote Kn F by Kn .
               Spec

   As we mentioned in the beginning of Section 4, there is a left action of Aop =
EndOS (OS ) × EndOS (I) × EndOS (J ) on the locally free sheaf P = OS ⊕ I ⊕ J .
So P ∈ P(X; Aop). The corresponding element [P] ∈ K0 (S; Aop ) deﬁnes a
morphism u : A → S in C. It follows from the construction of the realization
                         V
functor that φV = K0 (u) for any V . In particular, K0 (u) = φ.
Theorem 5.1. u : A → S is an isomorphism in C.
Proof. Let V be any F -variety. Equating K0 (V ; A) (resp. K0 (V × S)) with
                                     V
MorC (V, A) (resp. MorC (V, S)), K0 (u) : K0 (V ; A) → K0 (V × S) is just post-
                                                 V
composition in C with u. By Corollary 4.6, K0 (u) = φV is surjective for any
variety V . In particular, if V = S, there is an element v ∈ K0 (S; A) such that
uv = [O∆ ], i.e. u has a right inverse v in C.
   We want to show that v is also a left inverse to u in C, i.e. vu = [A] ∈
K0 (Aop ⊗F A). As K0 (Aop ⊗F A) ֒→ K0 ((Aop ⊗F A)F ) = K0 (Aop ⊗F AF ), it
                                                                   F
suﬃces to consider the case where K, L, B and Q are split. So A = F ×M3 (F ×
F )×M2 (F ×F ×F ), and thus A is isomorphic in C to F ×(F ×F )×(F ×F ×F )
(cf. example 1.6 of [6]). So K0 (A) ∼ Z6 , and MorC (A, A) = K0 (Aop ⊗F A) ∼
                                       =                                      =
M6 (Z). Moreover, under this isomorphism [A] ∈ K0 (Aop ⊗F A) corresponds to
the identity matrix.
   So vu ∈ K0 (Aop ⊗F A) is represented by a matrix M with integer entries.
It follows that the corresponding homomorphism K0 (vu) from K0 (A) ∼ Z6    =
to itself is multiplication by this matrix M. Now, as v is a right inverse
to u in C, K0 (v) is a right inverse to K0 (u). However, K0 (u) = φ is an
isomorphism by Theorem 4.2, so in fact K0 (v) = K0 (u)−1 . Thus K0 (vu) =
K0 (v)K0 (u) = idK0 (A) , which forces M to be the identity matrix. Thus vu =
[A] ∈ K0 (Aop ⊗ A), i.e. vu = idA in C.
Corollary 5.2. For any integer n, any central simple F -algebra D, and any
F -variety V ,
                       Kn (V ; A ⊗F D) ∼ Kn (V × S; D).
                                       =
In particular, Kn (F ) ⊕ Kn (B) ⊕ Kn (Q) = Kn (A) ∼ Kn (S).
                                                  =
Proof. For any central simple F -algebra D, Morita Equivalence gives a natural
isomorphism K0 (S; Aop ⊗F D op ⊗F D) = K0 (S; Aop ). Thus the isomorphism u :

A → S in C also deﬁnes an isomorphism from A⊗F D to (S, D) in C. Applying
the realization functor Kn yields Kn (V ; A ⊗F D) ∼ Kn (V × S; D).

  We conclude the paper with an Index Reduction Formula for the function
ﬁeld of the surface S(B, Q, KL). We will need the following lemma:
Lemma 5.3 ([10]). Let X be a irreducible F -variety, and D a central simple
F -algebra. The restriction homomorphism K0 (X; D) → K0 (DF (X) ) induced by
the inclusion Spec(F (X)) → X is surjective.
Lemma 5.4. Let X be an irreducible F -variety, and D a central simple F -
algebra.

         ind DF (X) =       g. c. d.{rank(P ), ∀P ∈ P(X; D)}.
                      deg D

Proof. We recall that for any ﬁeld E and any central simple E-algebra D ′ ,
K0 (D ′ ) is cyclic, generated by the class of a simple D ′ -module M ′ . Moreover,
dimE (M ′ ) = deg(D ′ ) ind(D ′ ).
  The rank homomorphism rank : K0 (X; D) → K0 (F (X)) has the following
decomposition:
                    K0 (X; D) → K0 (DF (X) ) → K0 (F (X)),
where the ﬁrst map is induced by the inclusion Spec(F (X)) → X, and the
second map takes the class of a DF (X) -module to the class of the corresponding
F (X)-vector space.
   As K0 (F (X)) is cyclic, the image of the rank homomorphism is n[F (X)],
where n is the greatest common divisor of the numbers rank(P ), for all P ∈
P(X; D). By the previous lemma, the homomorphism K0 (X; D) → K0 (DF (X) )
is surjective. Thus if M is a simple DF (X) -module,
      n = dimF (X) (M) = deg(DF (X) ) ind(DF (X) ) = deg(D) ind(DF (X) ),
and the result follows.
Corollary 5.5 (Index Reduction Formula). Let S = S(B, Q, KL) be a del
Pezzo surface of degree 6. For any central simple F -algebra D, ind DF (S) is
equal to:
      i. g. c. d.{ind(D), 2 ind(D ⊗F B), 3 ind(D ⊗F Q)}, if K and L are ﬁelds.
     ii. g. c. d.{ind(D), ind(D ⊗F B1 ), ind(D ⊗F B2 )}, if K = F × F and L is
         a ﬁeld. Here B = B1 × B2 .
    iii. g. c. d.{ind(D), ind(D ⊗F Q1 ), 2 ind(D ⊗F Q2 )}, if K is a ﬁeld, and
         L = F × E. Here Q = Q1 × Q2 .
    iv. g. c. d.{ind(D), ind(D ⊗F Q1 ), ind(D ⊗F Q2 ), ind(D ⊗F Q3 )}, if K is a
         ﬁeld, and L = F × F × F . Here Q = Q1 × Q2 × Q3 .
     v. ind D, when K and L are not ﬁelds.
Remark 5.6. In case ii., Q = M2 (L) is necessarily split, as K is not a ﬁeld.
Then ind(D ⊗F M2 (L)) = ind(DL ), and as ind(D) divides [L : F ] ind(DL ) =
3 ind(DL ), the greatest common divisor will not change if we remove the term

3 ind(D ⊗F Q). Similarly, in cases iii., iv., and v., we can remove the term with
the split B or Q when computing greatest common divisors.
Proof. As u : A → S is an isomorphism in C, it deﬁnes an isomorphism K0 (u)
from K0 (A ⊗F D) to K0 (S; D). Moreover, as A = F × B × Q, K0 (A ⊗F D) ∼      =
K0 (D) ⊕ K0 (B ⊗F D) ⊕ K0 (Q ⊗F D).
   We will consider the case where K and L are ﬁelds. The proof of the other
cases are similar. As D, B ⊗F D, and Q ⊗F D are central simple algebras
(with centers F , K, and L, respectively), their K0 groups are cyclic, generated
by the class of a simple module. Therefore by Lemma 5.4, deg(D) ind(DF (S) )
will equal the greatest common divisor of the ranks of the images of simple
D, B ⊗F D and Q ⊗F D modules under the image of K0 (u) : K0 (A ⊗F D) →
K0 (S; D).
   So let MB be a simple B ⊗F D-module. Then dimK (MB ) = deg(B ⊗F
D) ind(B ⊗F D), and thus
            rank(K0 (u)(MB )) = rank(MB ⊗B I)
                                    dimF (MB ) rank(I)
                                  =
                                         dimF (B)
                                    dimK (MB ) rank(I)
                                  =
                                         dimK (B)
                                    deg(B ⊗F D) ind(B ⊗F D) rank(I)
                                  =
                                                 dimK (B)
                                  = 2 deg(D) ind(B ⊗F D).
Similarly, if MQ (resp. MF ) is a simple Q ⊗F D-module (resp. D-module),
rank(K0 (u)(MQ )) = 3 deg(D) ind(D⊗F Q) (resp. rank(K0 (u)(MF )) = deg(D) ind(D)),
and the result follows.

                                                  Abstract. Let S be a degree six del Pezzo surface over an arbitrary ﬁeld F .
                                                  Motivated by the ﬁrst author’s classiﬁcation of all such S up to isomorphism [3]
                                                  in terms of a separable F -algebra B × Q × F , and by his K-theory isomorphism
                                                  Kn (S) ∼ Kn (B × Q × F ) for n ≥ 0, we prove an equivalence of derived

                                                  where A is an explicitly given ﬁnite dimensional F -algebra whose semisimple
                                                  part is B × Q × F .

                                             We will work over an arbitrary ﬁeld F .
                                             Throughout S denotes a degree six del Pezzo surface over F . Equivalently, S
                                          is a smooth projective surface over F whose anti-canonical sheaf is ample and has
                                          self-intersection number 6.

                                             Throughout F will denote a separable closure of F and we will write
                                                                         ¯                       ¯
                                                                         S = SF = S ×Spec F Spec F .
                                                                              ¯

                                             In [3], the ﬁrst author classiﬁed such S up to isomorphism by associating to S
                                          a pair of separable F -algebras B and Q, both deﬁned as endomorphism rings of
                                          certain locally free sheaves on S. Furthermore, it was shown there that the algebraic
                                          K-theory of S is isomorphic to that of the algebra B × Q × F .
                                             Let cohS denote the category of coherent sheaves on S and let modA denote
                                          the category of noetherian right A-modules. Let ≡ denote equivalence of derived
                                          categories. Our main result (Theorem 4.5) establishes a derived equivalence
                                          (1-1)                             Db (cohS) ≡ Db (modA)
                                          where A is a ﬁnite dimensional F -algebra whose semi-simple quotient is B × Q × F .
                                          We prove this equivalence by constructing a tilting bundle T on S that has A as
                                          its endomorphism ring. (The deﬁnition of a tilting bundle is given in section 4.)
                                          The main novelty of our approach is that we do not make any assumptions on the
                                          base ﬁeld F . Since the ﬁeld F is arbitrary, we cannot assume that S is obtained by
                                          blowing up P2 (in fact S could be a minimal surface), nor can we use exceptional

                                          collections.

Usually we only care about the class of a divisor in Pic S. We will write
                                       D1 ∼ D2
if D1 and D2 are linearly equivalent divisors.
   As remarked in the discussion after Prop. 2.1 in [3], the group of connected

components of the group Aut S is S2 × S3 , which can be identiﬁed with the au-
                                                       ¯
tomorphism group of the hexagon of (−1)-curves on S. In particular, there is an
element σ ∈ Aut(S)¯ that cyclically permutes the six exceptional lines. It is easy to
                                                 ¯
see that (1 + σ)(1 − σ 3 ) acts trivially on Pic S.
   An anti-canonical divisor is
                      −KS := L1 + L2 + L3 + M1 + M2 + M3 .
                        ¯

This is ample. We deﬁne two particular divisors
(2-2)      H := L1 + M2 + M3 ∼ L2 + M1 + M3 ∼ L3 + M1 + M2
and
(2-3)      H ′ := L1 + L2 + M3 ∼ L2 + L3 + M1 ∼ L3 + L1 + M2
    ¯
on S. Note that σ(H) ∼ H ′ and σ 2 (H) ∼ H.

However, each of these three Hom-spaces is isomorphic to a direct sum of terms of
               ¯ ¯
the form H 0 (S, OS (D)) for a divisor D with deg D < 0. But if D has a section
then D ∼ D′ for some eﬀective D′ so deg D = −D′ .K ≥ 0. These Hom spaces are
therefore zero.
  The projective dimension of a left T -module is denoted by pdimT M . The global
homological dimension of T is deﬁned and denoted by
                      gldim T := sup{pdimT M | M ∈ ModT }.
Proposition 2.2. gldim A ≤ 2.

Proof. Let R and S be rings and X an R-S-bimodule. If S is a semisimple ring,
then

                  gldim            = max{pdimR X + 1, gldim R}.

then to A with R = A′ and S = F , gives the desired result.

                       3. Cohomology vanishing lemmas
   We will prove several results about vanishing of cohomology and Ext-groups for
sheaves on S. These results will be used in Section 4 to show that T is a tilting
bundle and therefore induces an equivalence of derived categories.
   A key step in proving that T is tilting is showing that Exti (T , T ) = 0 for i > 0.
                                                              S
This reduces, by ﬂat base change, to proving that Exti¯ (T , T ) = 0. Given the
                                                           S
explicit description of T as a direct sum of invertible sheaves, it suﬃces to prove
that h1 (D − D′ ) = h2 (D − D′ ) = 0 for all D and D′ belonging to the list
(3-1)            H,    H ′,   L1 + M2 ,   L2 + M3 ,     L3 + M1 ,   0.
We will make repeated use of the relation Li + Mj ∼ Lj + Mi .
                                             ¯
Proposition 3.1. Let D and D′ be divisors on S appearing in the list (3-1). Then
                               −3 ≤ deg(D − D′ ) ≤ 3.
Furthermore,
   (1) if deg(D − D′ ) = 1, then D − D′ is linearly equivalent to an exceptional
       line.
   (2) if deg(D − D′ ) = 2, then D − D′ ∼ Li + Mj for some i = j ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
   (3) if deg(D − D′ ) = 3, then D − D′ is linearly equivalent to either H or H ′ .
   (4) if deg(D − D′ ) = 0, then D − D′ is linearly equivalent to either 0, Li − Lj ,
       Li − Mi , or Mi − Li for some i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
   (5) if deg(D − D′ ) < 0, then D − D′ is linearly equivalent to either −Li , or
       −Mj , or −Li − Mj , or −H, or −H ′ .
Proof. Exceptional lines have degree 1 so deg H = deg H ′ = 3 and deg(Li + Mj ) =
2. It follows that the degree of D − D′ is between 3 and -3.
   (1) If deg(D−D′ ) = 1, then D is linearly equivalent to H or H ′ and D′ = Li +Mj
for some i, j. It follows from (2-2) and (2-3) that D − D′ is linearly equivalent to
an exceptional line, and every exceptional line can occur as D − D′ .
   (2) and (3) are obvious.
   (4) In this case D and D′ have the same degree.
   If deg D = deg D′ = 2, then D = Li + Mj and D′ = Lk + Mℓ . By considering all
possible i, j, k, ℓ, we see that D − D′ is linearly equivalent to a divisor of the form
Li − Lj .
   If deg D = deg D′ = 3, then, for example, D ∼ H and D′ ∼ H ′ , and D − D′ ∼
Li − Mi . Switching the roles of H and H ′ , we see D − D′ ∼ Mi − Li . Finally, we
may have D − D′ ∼ 0.
   (5) This is the mirror of the cases (1)-(3).
          A DERIVED EQUIVALENCE FOR A DEGREE 6 DEL PEZZO SURFACE                               5


Corollary 3.2. Suppose D is the diﬀerence of two divisors appearing in the list

(3-1). If deg D ≥ −2, then there is an exceptional line E on S such that D − E is
also a diﬀerence of two divisors appearing in the list (3-1) and D.E ≥ −1.

Proof. This is established through case-by-case analysis using Proposition 3.1 to
look at all the possibilities for D.

  A divisor D on S is good if h1 (D) = h2 (D) = 0.

the result for −H.

By hypothesis, the left-most term in each row is zero. The right-most term in each
row is also zero because H i (S, OE (C)) ∼ H i (P1 , OP1 (C.E)). Hence C is good.

                            4. The tilting bundle T
    In this section, we show that T is a tilting bundle and prove our main result.
Proposition 4.1. Let i ≥ 1. Then Exti (T , T ) = 0.
                                    S
Proof. By ﬂat base change it suﬃces to prove this when F is separably closed so
                       ¯
we assume that F = F . In that case Exti (T , T ) is isomorphic to a direct sum of
                                           S
terms of the form H i (S, OS (D − D′ )) where D and D′ are divisors in the list (3-1).
   It therefore suﬃces to show that D − D′ is good whenever D and D′ are divisors
in the list (3-1).
   We argue by induction on deg(D −D′ ). By Proposition 3.1, −3 ≤ deg(D −D′ ) ≤
3. If deg(D − D′ ) = −3, then D − D′ is good by Lemma 3.3. Now suppose that
−2 ≤ deg(D − D′ ) ≤ 3. By Corollary 3.2, there is an exceptional line E such
that D − D′ − E is a diﬀerence of divisors in (3-1) and (D − D′ ).E ≥ −1. By the
induction hypothesis, D − D′ − E is good, and it then follows from Lemma 3.4 that
D − D′ is good.
          ¯
   Since S is a del Pezzo surface of degree ≥ 6 it is a toric variety so we can, and
will, make use of Cox’s homogeneous coordinate ring for it [5].
                               ¯
Lemma 4.2. Every F ∈ cohS has a ﬁnite resolution in which all terms are direct
sums of invertible sheaves OS (D) for various divisors D on S.

                                                               ¯
Proof. Let A be Cox’s homogeneous coordinate ring for S [5]. Then A is a
polynomial ring with a grading by Pic(S). ¯ Let M be a ﬁnitely generated graded
A-module. Then M has a ﬁnite projective resolution in the category of graded A-
modules. By [9, Lemma 2.2], every ﬁnitely generated projective graded A-module
                                                            ¯         ¯
is a direct sum of twists of A. The exact functor Gr(A, Pic(S)) → QcohS, M  M,
described in [5, Thm. 3.11] sends the resolution of M to an exact sequence in
      ¯
QcohS in which the right-most term is M and all other terms are direct sums of
                            ¯                 ¯
various OS (D), D ∈ Div(S). Given F ∈ cohS, there is a ﬁnitely generated graded
           ¯
A-module M such that F =     ∼ M.
  For the rest of this paper, we will work in the derived category. If D is a tri-
angulated category, we denote the shift of an object M by M[1]. Recall that a
subcategory of D is thick (´paisse) if it is closed under isomorphisms, shifts, taking
                           e
cones of morphisms, and taking direct summands of objects.
  Let D be a triangulated category and E a set of objects in D. Then
     • Dc denotes the full subcategory of D consisting of the compact objects, i.e.,
        those objects C such that HomD (C, −) commutes with direct sums;
     • E denotes the smallest thick full triangulated subcategory of D containing
        E;
     • E ⊥ denotes the full subcategory of D consisting of objects M such that
        HomD (E[i], M) = 0 for all E ∈ E and all i ∈ Z.
We say that
     • E generates D if E ⊥ = 0 and that
     • D is compactly generated if (Dc )⊥ = 0.
Clearly, if D is compactly generated and E = Dc , then E generates D.
Theorem 4.3 (Ravenel and Neeman [8]. Also see Thm. 2.1.2 in [4]). Let D be a
compactly generated triangulated category. Then a set of objects E ⊂ Dc generates
D if and only if E = Dc .

and
                        0 → OS (−M3 ) → OS → OM3 → 0
                             ¯           ¯

that OM3 and OS (−M3 ) belong to T . Hence OE and OS (−E) belong to T for
                  ¯                                      ¯
all exceptional lines E.
   Since Li .Lk = 0 if i = k, there is an exact sequence
              0 → OS (−Li − Lk ) → OS (−Li ) ⊕ OS (−Lk ) → OS → 0.
                   ¯                ¯           ¯           ¯

Twisting by Li + Mj + Lk , we obtain
      0 → OS (Mj ) → OS (Mj + Lk ) ⊕ OS (Li + Mj ) → OS (Li + Mj + Lk ) → 0.
           ¯          ¯               ¯               ¯

Therefore, OS (Mj ) ∈ T . From the exact sequence
            ¯

                      0 → OS → OS (Mj ) → OMj (Mj ) → 0,
                           ¯    ¯

we deduce that OMj (Mj ) ∈ T .
    It follows that OE (E) ∈ T for every exceptional curve E. But OE is also
in T so, because Db (cohP1 ) is generated by OP1¯ and OP1¯ (−1), it follows that
                             ¯

D (cohE) ⊂ T . Hence OE (D) ∈ T for all divisors D on S. ¯
    Suppose OS (D) ∈ T . Then OS (D − E) ∈ T because there is an exact
                ¯                   ¯
sequence
                     0 → OS (D − E) → OS (D) → OE (D) → 0.
                           ¯            ¯

Likewise, OS (D + E) ∈ T because there is an exact sequence
           ¯

                  0 → OS (D) → OS (D + E) → OE (D + E) → 0.
                       ¯        ¯

                                                  ¯
It follows that T contains OS (D) for all D ∈ Div S and therefore, by Lemma 4.2,
                             ¯
                            ¯
contains F for every F ∈ cohS.
   When F is not separably closed T need not split as a direct sum of line bun-
dles so the arguments in Theorem 4.4 can not be used to prove directly that
 T = Db (cohS). Instead we will show that T generates D(QcohS) and then apply
Theorem 4.3.

Theorem 4.5. Let F be an arbitrary ﬁeld. Then
                      RHomS (T , −) : Db (cohS) → Db (modA)
is an equivalence of categories.
Proof. We will show that T generates D(QcohS). It will then follow from Theorem
4.3 that
                             T = D(QcohS)c = Db (cohS).
By Proposition 4.1, Exti (T , T ) = 0 for i > 0. By Proposition 2.2, A = EndS (T )
                          S
has ﬁnite global dimension. Thus we have shown that T is a tilting bundle and our
theorem will then follow directly from [2, Thm. 3.1.2] (or [6, Thm. 7.6]).
   Let M ∈ D(QcohS) and suppose RHomS (T , M) = 0. We must show that
M = 0.
   Since T is locally free, Hom S (T , −) and T ∨ ⊗S − are exact functors on QcohS.
                               ∨
                                                                    ¯
Likewise, Hom S (T , −) and T ⊗S − are exact functors on QcohS. Thus, for ex-
                ¯                   ¯
ample, RHom S (T , M) can be computed on D(QcohS) by applying Hom S (T , −)
to each individual term in M.
   Consider the cartesian square

                                          u

Since u (and therefore v) is ﬂat, the natural transformation
                                   u∗ Rp∗ → Rq∗ v ∗
                                                    ¯
is an isomorphism of functors from D(QcohS) to D(F ) [7, (3.18)]. We now have
         0 = u∗ RHomS (T , M) ∼ u∗ Rp∗ RHom S (T , M) by [7, p.85]
                                 =
                                 ∼ Rq∗ v ∗ RHom S (T , M) by [7, (3.18)]
                                 =
                                   ∼ Rq∗ v ∗ (T ∨ ⊗L M)
                                   =               S
                                   ∼ Rq∗ (T ∨ ⊗L Lv ∗ M)
                                   =           ¯
                                               S
                                   ∼ Rq∗ RHom ¯ (T , Lv ∗ M)
                                   =            S
                                   ∼ RHom ¯ (T , Lv ∗ M).
                                   =          S
                      ¯
But T generates D(QcohS) so v M = 0. Since v ∗ is faithful, M = 0, and we are
                                   ∗

done.

Corollary 4.6 (cf. [3], Corollary 5.2). The functor HomS (T , −) : coh(S) → modA
induces an isomorphism
                     HomS (T , −) : K∗ (S) → K∗ (F × B × Q).
Proof. It follows from Theorem 1.98 of [10] that the equivalence of derived cate-
gories found in Theorem 4.5 induces an isomorphism in K-theory
                      HomS (T , −) : K∗ (cohS) → K∗ (modA).
Moreover, A has a nilpotent ideal I so that A/I is isomorphic to its semi-simple
quotient F × B × Q. Thus, it follows that the K-theory of A is isomorphic to that
of F × B × Q, and we recover the isomorphism found in [3].
